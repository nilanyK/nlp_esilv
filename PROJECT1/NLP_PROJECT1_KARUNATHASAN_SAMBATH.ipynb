            "Query PLAIN-1: why deep fried foods may cause cancer in the latest study on dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women , healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer , whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds . included in the unhealthy eating pattern was the consumption of deep-fried foods , which have previously been linked to breast cancer , pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , oral and throat cancers , esophageal cancer , and cancer of the voicebox . no deep fried foods ? what â s a southern belle to do ? instead of deep fried foods , how about the traditional southern diet , characterized by high intakes of cooked greens , beans , legumes , cabbage , sweet potatoes and cornbread , which may reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer significantly . what about the consumption of deep-fried foods and risk of prostate cancer ? researchers at the fred hutchinson cancer research center and the university of washington found that eating french fries , fried chicken , fried fish , and doughnuts was associated with about a third greater odds of prostate cancer . after stratifying for tumor aggressiveness , they found slightly stronger associations with more aggressive disease , suggesting that regular intake of deep-fried foods may contribute to the progression of prostate cancer as well . what in deep fried foods is so bad for us ? just heating oil that hot can generate potentially carcinogenic compounds , and then known carcinogens such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form when the muscles of chickens and fish are cooked at that temperature . deep-fried plants , on the other hand , can form acrylamide . i did a video about acrylamide back in 2008 , suggesting it â s a probable human carcinogen ( see acrylamide in french fries ) . since then , studies have suggested pregnant women may want to cut back on french fries to protect the growth of their baby â s body and brain . based on a study ( highlighted in my video , cancer risk from french fries ) feeding people a little bag of potato chips every day for a month , it now seems acrylamide may also cause inflammation as well , which could explain its purported role in cancer progression . acrylamide intake has been associated with endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , lung cancer , kidney cancer , and esophageal cancer . how much cancer risk are we talking about ? taiwanese researchers examined lifetime cancer risk and french fry consumption . the researchers picked on french fries because they comprise by far the greatest percentage contribution of acrylamide to the diets of children . they estimated that , at most , one or two boys and girls out of every ten thousand would develop cancer eating french fries that they would otherwise not have developed if they hadn â t eaten french fries . so it â s not as bad as eating something like fried fish , or fried chicken , but how much is that saying ? the level of cancer risk in both boys and girls associated with french fries depends on how long and hot they â re fried . in europe , the food industry swore that they â d self-regulate and control fry times to decrease acrylamide levels , but we â ve yet to see any subsequent change in acrylamide levels in french fries . researchers continue to urge that the cooking temperature should be as low as possible and the cooking time should be as short as possible , â while still maintaining a tasty quality â of course . we wouldn â t want to reduce cancer risk too much â they might not taste as good ! blanching the potatoes first reduces acrylamide formation , but potato chip companies complain that , not only would it muck with the flavor , but it would reduce the nutritional properties by leaching away some of the vitamin c. but if we â re relying on potato chips to get our vitamin c , acrylamide is probably the least of our worries . more on heterocyclic amines : there are some things we can do to counteract the effects of these carcinogens , though : i touch on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in meat fumes : dietary secondhand smoke and is liquid smoke flavoring carcinogenic ? certain fats may play a role in breast cancer survival as well : breast cancer survival , butterfat , and chicken and breast cancer survival and trans fat . even before the oil gets in the fryer , it â s been heavily damaged by the refining process . the multi-step process to take a whole food seed to a refined oil leaves behind oxidized , reactive fatty acids and chemical residues.does this refining process oxidize vegan dha pills , making these fats harmful ? i hope not . great question ! of the well known dietary fatty acids , dha has the highest peroxidation index . do the manufactures add an antioxidant to their dha products ? agreed , great question ! it may be more of a question for the manufacturer . we do know that dha oil from algae appear effective . another study here.yes , but does the dha vegan supplement also provide epa , or just dha ? this is important , no ? i â ve seen most vegan dha supplements make no mention of the product containing epa . fish oil has both . maybe you can clear this up for me , i assume i am missing something here in the understanding.leslie : i â ve seen quite a few commercial , algea-based omega three pills which include both dha and epa . here â s just one example ( not one i â m promoting . just the first one that popped up in a random search ) : http : / / www.devanutrition.com / vegan-dha-epa-delayed-release-omega-3.htmli â m sure there are also pills with just the dha , but i don â t think it is hard to find ones with the epa too if that â s what you want.how is it that some algae provide both dha and epa , and others do not ? i figured that algae in itself always contained both the dha and epa , as fish oil contains both dha and epa and the fish get it from eating algae . but some vegan companies say just dha . hmmmm â¦ .leslie : i had assumed that the difference between different pill claims was due to different processing techniques . but you could be right . it could be that the pills which only claim to have dha are simply not reporting the epa ? i really have no clue.hi leslie : most algal dha supplements contain only dha . increasingly though there â re products with both dha and epa . if you type in â vegan omega-3 â³ on amazon , you can find them , but they are even more expensive than algal dha-only products . it â s , of course , good to take both dha and epa but not essential because dha and epa equilibrate in the body : if you took only dha , some of it would be converted to epa , and vice versa.i find it thought provoking that the fish oil companies are shifting to balancing their dha epa supplement to contain more epa than dha , as a greater amount of epa than dha in the body has been found to be more effective for mood issues , as well as some feel other issues as well . vegans may be compromising themselves by taking dha only â¦ .creating a level of dha and epa that might adversely effect them.http : / / www.nutraingredients-usa.com / research / epa-stands-alone-as-a-depression-fighterhttps : / / labdoor.com / article / epa-to-dha-ratio-a-benefits-and-risks-analysisseems like a good question for one of the manufacturers like nordic.from the study you linked tohttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23651876 dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women . â the â healthy â food pattern was characterized by the consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy products , legumes , olive and vegetable oils , fish , condiments , organ meat , poultry , pickles , soya and whole grains ; while the â unhealthy â food pattern was characterized by the consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea and coffee , french fries and potato chips , salt , sweets and desserts , hydrogenated fats , nuts , industrial juice , refined grains , and red and processed meat . â so â the â healthy food pattern â included low fat dairy , olive and vegetable oils , organ meat and poultry â ! ! and excluded tea ! ? ! this study exemplifies the importance of the ability to read the study and understand the statistical method in order to interpret the study correctly . they did what is known as principal component analysis ( https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / principal _ component _ analysis ) as their factor analytic technique . the goal was dimension reduction prior to statistical analysis , not a direct inference of a best-fit â healthy â pattern and a best fit â unhealthy â pattern â really this would make no sense for a two-factor model since the unhealthiest pattern would be simply the negative of the healthiest pattern and there would only be one factor.the correct interpretation of their statistics is that : 1 ) they first found two orthogonal factors which varied significantly in their sample . that is , there is â a-type â variation in which consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy , etc , all increase together , and some of the other dietary components decrease . then there is â b-type â variation in which consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea , etc all increase together , and some other dietary components decrease . the sample diets from the ffq varied from person to person a fair bit in both the a-way and the b-way . the study calls them â healthy â and â unhealthy â but based on the characteristics given they could also plausibly be called â traditional / rural â and â urban / industrial â . 2 ) in a model that looked at both a-ness and b-ness of diets as independent variables , a-ness was found to associate with higher breast cancer risk while b-ness was found to associate with lower risk . if you had to pick between a-ness and b-ness as the only ways in which you could vary your diet to protect yourself from breast cancer , your best bet would be to reduce b and increase a. that said , a and b cannot be interpreted simply as straightforward lists of healthy / unhealthy things . in fact there are very obvious reasons why tea consumption would tend to increase along with all the other refined and processed foods , that have nothing to do with tea â s health per se . there are also obvious reasons why organ meats might be more common among people with greater access to other fresh and traditional foods , that have nothing to do with the health of organ meats per se.if you had to ask me the study is valuable but it doesn â t do much to pinpoint exactly what is good or bad for breast cancer . we rely on other research in order to interpret what the healthiest dietary pattern for preventing breast cancer might be . note that in greger â s article the study in question is only introduced as the latest , not the greatest . in many respects , the study isn â t all that great.this is what dr greger said â â healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer , whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds â again â the healthier eating pattern included vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy products , legumes , olive and vegetable oils , fish , condiments , organ meat , poultry , pickles , soya and whole grains.no matter how you want to spin it you can â t.however it would be useful if the good doctor would post a link to the entire study not just the abstract.the study is freely accessible , charles , and can be reached from the source link to the publisher on greger â s pubmed citation . greger is quoting his results from table 3 , model ii . i should mention that i misspoke a bit in calling these models â univariate â . they focus on only one pattern at a time as the independent variable of interest , but their other statistical controls such as age , menopausal status , etc , are independent variables also . note that i haven â t said anything about the quality of greger â s reporting on the study yet , either . given that your op talked about the study and not what greger said , i assumed we were talking about what the study itself means.read the study and try to comprehend what i wrote as something other than â spin â , then i might get back to you . i assure you that they found two patterns which spanned about 24-31 % of dietary variation in the population , then asked how healthy those patterns actually were . they did not ask up front â what is the pattern whose variation explains the greatest variation in health outcomes ? â . the latter form of questioning is well-framed to get you a list that distinguishes apparently healthy foods from apparently unhealthy , while the former is not.this study exemplifies the importance of the ability to read the study and understand the statistical method in order to interpret the study correctly . they did what is known as principal component analysis ( https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / principal _ component _ analysis ) as their factor analytic technique . the goal was dimension reduction prior to statistical analysis , not a direct inference of a best-fit â healthy â pattern and a best fit â unhealthy â pattern â really this would make no sense for a two-factor model since the unhealthiest pattern would be simply the negative of the healthiest pattern and there would only be one factor.the correct interpretation of their statistics is that : 1 ) they first found two orthogonal factors which varied significantly in their sample . that is , there is â a-type â variation in which consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy , etc , all increase together , and some of the other dietary components decrease . then there is â b-type â variation in which consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea , etc all increase together , and some other dietary components decrease . the sample diets from the ffq varied from person to person a fair bit in both the a-way and the b-way . the study calls them â healthy â and â unhealthy â but based on the characteristics given they could also plausibly be called â traditional / rural â and â urban / industrial â . 2 ) in a model that looked at both a-ness and b-ness of diets as independent variables , a-ness was found to associate with higher breast cancer risk while b-ness was found to associate with lower risk . if you had to pick between a-ness and b-ness as the only ways in which you could vary your diet to protect yourself from breast cancer , your best bet would be to reduce b and increase a. that said , a and b cannot be interpreted simply as straightforward lists of healthy / unhealthy things . in fact there are very obvious reasons why tea consumption would tend to increase along with all the other refined and processed foods , that have nothing to do with tea â s health per se . there are also obvious reasons why organ meats might be more common among people with greater access to other fresh and traditional foods , that have nothing to do with the health of organ meats per se.if you had to ask me the study is valuable but it doesn â t do much to pinpoint exactly what is good or bad for breast cancer . we rely on other research in order to interpret what the healthiest dietary pattern for preventing breast cancer might be . note that in greger â s article the study in question is only introduced as the latest , not the greatest . in many respects , the study isn â t all that great.a litttle more nuancing might help . i obtain lots of vegetable from my grocery garden , wich i store in my freezer for winter time , after boiling it for a short minute . i may hope that that is not so bad ! as i understand , boiling in water and steaming don â t cause acrylamide formation . it â s the burning of plant foods due to dry heating that leads to acrylamide.thanks ! the issue for me with fat supplementation is this ; many many people arer taking all kinds of omega â s , olive , primrose oils etc . can we clarify the research as to how they oxidize and cause damage ? they layman really has no idea on how to proceed and not create chaos with the oils they take . now dr peter glidden is against all oils for the most part . i think he makes an exception for youngevity efa and maybe coconut oils . any help to clarify would go a long way.great point , anthony . a guest below also had a comment about oxidation . maybe this can be another nutritionfacts research fund project ? dr. greger has a video about the true shelf life of cooking oils . it would be nice to see more on the oils you mention.so would fried coconut oil be safe , and organic potato chips fried in just organic coconut oil not be an issue / problem , as far as arrylamide content as well as oxidation , inflammation ? wondering what you think about this . i have no idea.is it safe to bake potatoes , etc. in the oven brushed with a little olive oil ? what is the temperature at which acrylamide formation becomes a concern ? hi jan . here is a video about the best way to cook sweet potatoes . it â s really the french fries ( deep frying ) that is problematic , as they are laden with acrylamide . here is a study looking at acrylamide and temperature . this study mentions how cooking time and temperature may determine acrylamide levels.i watched that video & i like the fact that dr. greger won â t compromise quantity of good food vs. quality .. he mentions that best way of eating such a healthy food as sweet potato is how you get most of it .. therefore if someone doesn â t have time or facility to boil , they don â t have to stop eating it ! one can bake & eat more of it to get same nutrients . that obviously doesn â t apply to french fries , but reminds me about some schools or work places , which only provide students / employees with french fries & no better alternative . here the challenge is either eat the deep fried potatoes or stay hungry .. this is a much more difficult decision to make , and for me as an advocate for public health is an example of how important is infrastructure changes to have healthier nation.good information . i will be sharing the informationi will be lurking around the net trying to find out about the dangers of oxidation of oils . if anyone else finds anything please post.beast carcinogen indeedhow about air popped popcorn ? hot temperature ? starch ? short cooking time ? sounds like a recipe for acrylamide . i would be bummed â¦ i love my air popped popcorn. acrylamide , beans , breast cancer , cabbage , cancer , cancer survival , carcinogens , chicken , children , cooking methods , doughnuts , endometrial cancer , endometrial health , esophageal cancer , esophageal health , europe , fish , french fries , frying , greens , heterocyclic amines , industry influence , inflammation , kidney cancer , legumes , lung cancer , men 's health , oils , oral cancer , ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , potato chips , poultry , prostate cancer , sweet potatoes , throat cancer , turkey , vitamin c , women 's health - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-11: living longer by reducing leucine intake many studies have shown that calorie restriction , without malnutrition , can increase lifespan and lower the risk of age-related diseases , such as cancer . however , for many people , calorie restriction clearly has its drawbacks . in the classic minnesota starvation study , many of the volunteers suffered a preoccupation with food , constant hunger , binge eating , and lots of emotional and psychological issues . even researchers who study caloric restriction rarely practice it . there â s got to be a better way to suppress the aging engine enzyme , tor ( see why do we age ? for more on tor ) . that â s why researchers were so excited about rapamycin , a drug that inhibits tor , thinking it could be caloric restriction in a pill . but like any drug , it a long list of potentially serious side effects . there â s got to be a better way . the breakthrough came when scientists discovered that the benefits of dietary restriction may be coming not from restricting calories , but from restricting protein intake ( see my video caloric restriction vs. animal protein restriction ) . if we look at the first comprehensive , comparative meta-analysis of dietary restriction , â the proportion of protein intake was more important for life extension than the degree of caloric restriction . â in fact , just â reducing protein without any changes in calorie level have been shown to have similar effects as caloric restriction . â that â s good news . protein restriction is much less difficult to maintain than dietary restriction , and it may even be more powerful because it suppresses both tor and igf-1 , the two pathways thought responsible for the dramatic longevity and health benefits of caloric restriction . some proteins are worse than others . one amino acid in particular , leucine , appears to exert the greatest effect on tor . in fact , just cutting down on leucine may be nearly as effective as cutting down on all protein . where is leucine found ? predominantly animal foods : eggs , dairy , and meat ( including chicken and fish ) . plant foods , such as fruits , vegetables , grains , and beans , have much less . â in general , lower leucine levels are only reached by restriction of animal proteins . â to reach the leucine intake provided by dairy or meat , we â d have to eat nine pounds of cabbage â about four big heads â or 100 apples . these calculations exemplify the extreme differences in leucine amounts provided by a conventional diet in comparison to a plant-based diet . the functional role of leucine in regulating tor activity may help explain the extraordinary results reported in the cornell-oxford-china study , â since quasi-vegan diets of modest protein content tend to be relatively low in leucine . â this may also help explain the longevity of populations like the okinawa japanese , who have about half our mortality rate . the traditional okinawan diet is only about 10 % protein , and practically no cholesterol , because they ate almost exclusively plants . less than one percent of their diet was fish , meat , eggs , and dairy â the equivalent of one serving of meat a month and one egg every two months . their longevity is surpassed only by vegetarian adventists in california , who have perhaps the highest life expectancy of any formally studied population in history . this reminds me of the study i profiled in the benefits of caloric restriction without the actual restricting . methionine is another amino acid that may be associated with aging . see methionine restriction as a life extension strategy to find out which foods to avoid in that case . both leucine and methionine content may be additional reasons why plant protein is preferable . other reasons why those eating plant-based diets may live longer : this all may help explain the results of harvard â s meat and mortality studies . what are the practical protein recommendations for us to follow ? how much protein should we eat daily to not activate tor , but to fulfill our nutritional needs ? can we eat unlimited vegetable protein since it is low in leucine and methionine ? here are some protein recommendations . in the last link of this blog dr. greger mentions how plant protein is preferable . it â s hard to say exactly how much protein to restrict to suppress tor . the recommendations for protein intake vary from 10-35 % of total calories . the tradition okinawan diet is only about 10 % protein , so perhaps the lower end of that range ( 10-35 % ) is preferred.maybe this is a stretch , but i was thinking that if nature provides growing , developing infants with an ideal formula in mother â s milk , maybe our nutritional guidelines should be based close to that proven ratio , so i investigated it and was very surprised by what i found â¦ ( remember it is mostly water . ) mature human milk contains 3 % â 5 % fat , 0.8 % â 0.9 % protein , 6.9 % â 7.2 % carbohydrate calculated as lactose , and 0.2 % mineral constituents expressed as ash . its energy content is 60 â 75 kcal / 100 ml.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 392766thanks , charzie . since the values you gave are by weight , i converted them to percent of calories . human breast milk contains ~ 5 % protein , 54 % fat and 41 % carbohydrate . pretty surprising that protein is so low . i â m guessing that the growing infant needs lots of healthy fats for brain development , that adults probably don â t.thanks so much julie , a math whiz i am not , but thought it was interesting with all the questions about protein we get grilled about . i agree about the brain growth and the fat % â¦ plus it is very easy to digest and utilize and comes with all kinds of amazing benefits , including even pro and pre biotics . once past nursing age i â m sure the ratios shift to less fat and more carbs , ( but cow â s milk is never an acceptable substitute for infants for numerous reasons . ) if adults ingest that much fat , well â¦ i had diabetes and it was all about the fat because dropping it to > 10 % made it go away before i even lost much weight ! the amino acid in plant based diets that is likely to be limiting is lysine ( not to be confused with leucine ) . consume enough lysine in a varied plant based diet , and you â re likely to have adequate amounts of all the other essential amino acids.beans , greens and potatoes have more lysine relative to their leucine + methionine content than other higher protein plant foods : potatoes ( 0.83 ) , legumes , greens ( 0.7 ) , nuts & seeds ( 0.5 ) grains ( 0.3 ) , so even though the leucine content of beans may seem high in absolute terms , they still offer the best balance of adequate lysine without excess leucine and methionine . food group leaders by this measure include cauliflower ( 1.72 ) , split peas and lentils ( 0.86 ) , pumpkin seeds ( 0.70 ) , buckwheat & quinoa ( 0.67 ) .the more i look at potatoes , the more they appear like the ideal staple . compare the percent of amino acid requirements for a 60 kg adult in 2000 kcal of these foods : potato skim milk whole eggs his 147 % 1000 % 720 % iso 141 % 853 % 782 % leu 106 % 802 % 649 % lys 151 % 921 % 709 % met + cys 159 % 712 % 1013 % phe + tyr 220 % 1353 % 1099 % thr 180 % 941 % 864 % try 227 % 1053 % 973 % val 168 % 833 % 769 % fiber 203 % 0 % 0 % one could eat nothing but potatoes and get adequate but not excessive amounts of every essential amino acid ( and be well ahead on the fiber and potassium fronts , as well ) .thanks , darryl . i eat lots of beans , greens and potatoes so i guess i â m all set on amino acids.darryl , i â m curious , what is your area of expertise ? thanks for all your amazing insights here on nf forum.i have an undergraduate degree in biochemistry but have worked most recently in computer science . i just discovered ( largely inspired by dr. greger ) a fascination with the underreported sides of nutritional science , and in particular its relation to chronic and aging-related disease , and so for the past two years , on average i download 3-5 papers daily from the primary literature , and when i find time read a couple.cool ! biochemistry is definitely an great foundation for the field of nutrition . so , you are in the vanguard of two fields that can change the world ( nutrition and technology ) . amazing ! keep going ! what do you make of the glycemic load of potatoes ? according to nutritiondata , the gl of a large baked russet is 29 . see http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / vegetables-and-vegetable-products / 2550 / 2there â s no question potatoes have a pretty high glycemic index , and hence present an issue for those who already have insulin resistance or diabetes . there â s perhaps a saving grace in that a substantial fraction of their starch will gelatinise / anneal into digestion resistant starch if baked and allowed to cool for a few hours.sweet potatoes are nutritionally superior in most respects , with 2000 kcal complete in all essential nutrients for a 60 kg adult except b9 , k , se , and maybe efas ( some greens and a brazil nut would fix this ) , and moreover have a glycemic index about half that of potatoes . i wish that i enjoyed their taste more ( i find them too sweet in most dishes ) .darryl : thanks for this post . i like how you put all that information together . very helpful.re : â â¦ i wish that i enjoyed their taste more . â you may feel that way about all sweet potatoes , but i thought i would share that i find that the sweet potatoes that are white or purple-fleshed are a lot less sweet than the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes . and i have had great success in substituting those types / colors of sweet potatoes in dishes without problem . sometimes i even like the sweet ones better in dishes that call for regular potatoes.i just wanted to share because i generally do not like the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and was happy to discover a few years ago that the other colors actually taste different to me . plus they have a better texture than the orange ones i think.just sharing.adding fiber or fat will low the glycemic load of potatoes â and of any food , so to speak.and what about the phytonutrients in potatoes ? i have been following a plant based diet for the last 2 years , and before that i used to intermittently fast every 3 months to lower my igf-1 and mtor levels , which i get measured every few months . since following your site the last few months and reading the very interesting article i have increased my intake of black beans and other legumes to benefit from their potential . however this article about leucine seems contradictory to that of increasing bean intake , such as black beans , to improve long appear to contain a reasonable quantity of leucine.leucine is still an essential amino acid so humans require dietary sources . the average 140 pound adult needs roughly 2673 mg per day . also , i feel if we spend too much time worrying about one essential amino acid we forget about the massive amount of iron , zinc , fiber , antioxidants and phytochemicals in black beans . they are such a healthful food that i would hate to see folks limit them based off their higher leucine content.that was my thinking as well , i will see how my increased consumption in black beans has affected my igf-1 levels next week . keep you posted ; - ) ) thanksplease , chris â really interested to know what have worked best in lowering igf-1 levels ! what is the current thinking on resveratrol and aging ? the primary target for resveratrol is activation of sirt 1 . there are a lot of data â out there â regarding resveratrol â some data suggest reduced risk for cardiovascular disease , diabetes , some neurological diseases and various cancers . probably no effect on maximum lifespan in humans ( as opposed to cr ) , but probably effect on health span in some subgroups . resveratrol is not the fountain of youth and resveratrol can in no way outweigh a poor diet . regarding health there are no alternative to a diet as near as possible to wfpb diet.plantstrongdoc gave the link to a study in another blog i â ll post it here , if interested . thanks , dommy ! joseph , as you know resveratrol is just one out af several polyphenols that have been extensively studied â others are quercetin , genistein , catechin and others â and data suggests considerable health benefits . resveratrol is probably famous because it is present in red wine â and hence a very studied compound . others are also â potent compounds â â and the â secret â behind the enormous health benefits from a plant based diet is probably a synergistic effect from all the polyphenols and it can of course not just be reduced to resveratrol or quercetin â but a very interesting field.this is not news to nf readers but here â s the latest study correlating nut consumption and longevity : â nuts and peanuts , but not peanut butter , may protect against death from cancer , heart disease , respiratory disease , and other major causes â http : / / www.alphagalileo.org / viewitem.aspx ? itemid = 153534 & culturecode = enthank you , joseph.awesome. thank you ! just curious , what does the photo have to do with this topic . looks like a mcdonald â s fish sandwich.i was trying to contrast caloric restriction versus animal protein restriction â quantity of food versus quality of food . sounds like it didn â t come across . if you can find a better creative commons pic i â ll swap it out ! not an easy task. how about this : https : / / flic.kr / p / 53rvyti will some more for a photo . the other thing i don â t get about the picture above is the shoe lace or whatever that is . and is that photo supposed to be showing both animal protein and plant protein ? i don â t see that . not an important part of this great article , just something that made me wonder.dr. greger , i posted the below comment on your calorie restriction vs. animal protein restriction video : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction / i â m glad you wrote more about this topic , but i â d love for you to discuss more about the shared connection mtor has with aging and muscle protein synthesis . the studies i reference below discuss how mtor is the pathway that leucine uses to signal muscle protein synthesis . for plant-based people who want to build lean muscle mass , i ask again , are these goals ( longevity vs. building lean muscle mass ) fundamentally opposed goals since they both seem to occur through the same amino acid ( leucine ) acting on the same signaling pathway ( mtor ) ? or , hypothetically , could is be a case of plant vs. animal sources of protein similar to your dozen videos on plant vs. meat nitrates ( see more in my original comment below ) .thanks for your consideration.original comment â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â it seems that both signaling muscle protein synthesis ( mps ) and aging prematurely ( as discussed in this and previous video ) involve the leucine / mtor connection . do you think , or is there research , that long life and building muscle mass are fundamentally opposed goals based on how our body is designed ? also , do you think , or is there research , that the mtor theory of aging and leucine acting as a trigger could be meat / animal-protein specific ? in other words , could eating leucine-rich plant foods in order to signal mps still provide longevity benefits as well as muscle-building benefits ? kind of similar to the whole nitrate / nitrite conundrum where plant-sourced nitrates ( from beets and arugula ) get metabolized in the stomach and re-sent to the mouth where , instead of becoming carcinogenic nitrosamines ( as is what happens when you consume nitrates from meat ) , they become no and increase our oxygen efficiency . this seems plausible to me since you â ve praised pumpkins seeds ( which are relatively high in leucine ) in some past videos : ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = p â¦ specifically the mineral content and serotonin boosting effect.research papers describing mps and leucine signaling : â http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16365096 â http : / / jap.physiology.org / content / 106 / 6 / 2026 â http : / / www.biolayne.com / wp-content / uploads / norton-j-ag-food-ind-hi-tech-2008.pdfhi michael . i meant to give this to you earlier , thanks for the reminder ! here are a few position papers that discuss protein needs in athletes . 1 ) nutrition and athletic performance and 2 ) position of the american dietetic association and dietitians of canada : vegetarian diets and a more recent version , here . the exact amount of protein for athletes to maintain and build muscle mass without stimulating tor is very hard to determine . i do not think any study has been conducted to know for certain . again , i think you â re onto something , as even though pumpkin seeds may be higher in leucine they provide fiber , antioxidants , and other phytochemicals that eggs and chicken do not.i think this is an important question . sarcopenia is a serious concern for older people ( like me ) as it can lead to falls , fractures , diabetes , or otherwise restrict the quality of one â s life . i find it sad to see older people who are frail due to sarcopenia , since it is unnecessary . it is certainly significantly more difficult to build lean muscle when one is over 65 , at least that â s my personal experience . because of this , i think it wise to pay attention to muscle mass when one is younger ( wish i had paid more attention ) â it â s much easier to maintain it than create when one is a senior . living longer does not necessarily mean a better quality of life . picking out one aspect of health ( not stimulating tor ) and then overly restricting protein to achieve that one goal could well backfire way down the road.here â s the url for a short and inconclusive overview of some studies and issue from harvard : http : / / www.health.harvard.edu / blog / daily-protein-needs-seniors-still-unsettled-201406117208great point , for those over 65 more protein is required . the low end of protein recommendations are between 0.8-0.9g / kg for adults . after 65 years old , based on this study , i would suggest bumping up these recommendations.i also saw that study when was published several months ago . i recall they categorized less than 10 % of calories from protein â low protein ' ; between 10 and 20 % â moderate protein ' ; and over 20 % protein â high protein â diets . those under 65 did better on low and moderate protein diets , but those over 65 did better on high protein diets insofar as cancer was concerned â¦ but they had much more diabetes . so it â s a tough call to recommend a high protein diet even for seniors . i guess it really depends on how many calories you take in.for a typical 80 kg . ( 175 lb . ) man , a moderate recommendation would be 1 gram of protein x 80 , or 80 grams / day . say this guy eats 2,400 calories â which a lot of active men do . 80 grams of protein is about 320 calories , so he should be aiming for 320 / 2,400 or 12.5 % of calories from protein . that â s low-moderate . to be considered â high protein â , he â d have to consume over 480 protein calories , or 120 grams . that â s 50 % over the moderate recommendation of 1 gram per kg. of body weight , and nearly twice the rda set by official health organizations ( 0.8 grams per kg . ) .i just doubt that getting 1.5 grams / kg. is a good idea when so many seniors suffer from reduced kidney function ( about a third of those > 60 have stage 3 ckd ) . but maybe vegetable sourced protein is ok ? thanks for sharing your thoughts . i think it â s noteworthy that the high protein group eating animal protein in this study was responsible for 75 % increased overall mortality and a 4-fold increase in risk of dying from cancer , compared with higher protein intake from plant sources . the increased risk of diabetes mortality seemed strange . i wonder if they controlled for animal protein ? i would agree that 1.0g / kg is probably better than 1.5g / kg , but keep in mind protein recommendations vary based on individual needs.thanks for the reply . the study you cite is very interesting , particularly to me the part about older people having more difficulty producing sufficient igf-1 for good health ( not sure what that level might be ) .this underscores the fact that nutrition and health is a complicated topic ! more of something is not necesssarily better , but the same can be said for less.i share your concern about getting enough protein to just maintain strength and muscle mass at 60 this yr . i â ve been pretty much vegan for 2 yrs and lost 15 lbs down to 150 at 6ft tall . i measure my strength every month by how many pushups , situps , pullups , and dumbbell presses i can do . i didn â t want to become the typical skinny , weak vegan example . out of 21 meals i include one with fish.i recently upped my protein to maybe 50 or 60g from a low in the 30-40 area as it was a struggle to keep up the reps and no muscle mass gains . all downhill into our 80s â¦ grr so i â ll see if that makes a difference . a vegan muscle building site recommends 150g of protein for a 150lb man . i â m not about to do that.i am 81 and fair health but nothing serious , yet . i read this about leucine . â excess leucine may be a cause of pellagra , whose main symptoms are â the four d â s â : diarrhea , dermatitis , dementia and death , [ 10 ] though the relationship is unclear â i have considered adding protein powder to my morning smoothies . doesn â t seem like a good idea . i don â t work out except a short walk a few times a week but watching my diet and food i eat . i am 5ft 7in and 154 lb.sounds like you â re doing pretty darn good at 81 rob . i guess i raised the bar pretty high for myself having the superman jack lalanne for a role model .. lol he was in great shape all the way to 97 by working out every morning at 5 and then 6am for more than an hr . he ate alot of fruit and salad , but also ate egg whites and salmon every day . i â m trying to avoid doing that.i am wondering why your protein intake is so low compared to mine . according to chron-o-meter , a typical days worth of food on my diet provides about 75g of protein . since i am only 5 â 7 â³ , small framed and 124 pounds ( 56 kg ) , i doubt my difficulty building muscle is protein related since i â m getting about 1.3g / kg / day , which i â ve seen recommended for seniors ( i â m 68 ) . when i used to do a lot of weight lifting ( which i only started in my early 50s ) , i was a long time vegetarian but ate a lot of dairy , including whey protein , but quit heavy lifting and focused on aerobic conditioning about 3-4 years ago , and about a year ago switched from long time vegetarian to vegan . the combined change dropped my weight from about 142 to 124 . i am happy about losing fat but i clearly also lost a lot of muscle as i am not nearly as strong these days . i am trying hard to regain some of that muscle but it is a struggle . i have read that for seniors , increasing volume of resistance exercise is needed to adequately stimulate muscle growth , but don â t have the references handy . keep up the good fight ! i guess i get too full eating fruit , potato and salad and haven â t paid much attention to protein . i don â t use protein powder , just added beans 3 times a day , plus quinoa and sweet peas . i did some exercise most of my life . i guess i miss the good old days at age 30 when gaining strength and size was easy and felt strong before a workout . i haven â t really lost any muscle at 60 and i â d like to keep it that way . but i am finding it harder to make any gains.well after 2 wks of increasing my plant protein and a bit of fat from nuts i â m pleased with the results in both strength and mass . also feel stronger and more â puffed up â in the legs , back and arms . that â s a big plus because it helps make the wrinkles in the arms and even under my eyes decrease . i may not have been eating enough fat along with enough protein . i also gained 3 lbs , to 153 assuming it is muscle . so it â s not all downhill ( getting weaker ) from 60 to 80 even on a plant based diet.sitting 50 lb overhead press increased from 22 to 31 my weakest event . squats with 35 lb from 32 to 42 reps , 5 sets pull-ups 5 to 7 chin-ups 7 to 8 sit-ups still 80 in 2 min.now i am wondering whether significantly increased amounts of leucine post strenuous exercise , e.g. from heavy weight lifting , might not have the negative effects it would otherwise have . the last article cited by michael got me thinking about this.leucine is still an essential amino acid . i think the idea is that consuming too much may be problematic , but lower amounts are fine and still necessary . i suggest shooting for the low end of protein recommendations , but as we discussed bumping up needs after 65 years old.i am pretty sure the calorie-restriction-longevity idea has been discredited for humans ( even though it holds for rats and mice ) . not that it is central to your posting . but it might be best not to feature that idea since it seems to fly in the face of evidence ( for humans and at least some other primates ) .instead of just saying that , perlis , can you show us a link to something that goes against the evidence that the doctor stated . thanks , johnhas cr been discredited ? there are contradictory primate studies on this issue , both of which have some serious issues . as for the human studies , none is long enough to make a proper determination of lifespan extension , but most biomarkers look positive for cr . one thing that is quite clear , is that equilibrium species ( such as humans ) are not going to see the 30-40 % maximal lifespan increases with cr that have been shown for mice . the traditional long-lived okinawans are perhaps the best example of moderate cr combined with low protein intake , but there are several other lifestyle factors that likely contribute as well.vegetarian adventists in california study

healthy choices . this is not at all to say that exercising , not smoking , and so on aren â t very important to one â s health , but diet really does seem to be the most important factor of all . i believe that there are other videos here related to this topic that i didn â t have time to browse around for but that i vaguely remember.this is only a partial answer to your question , but the

i believe that there are other videos here related to this topic that i didn â t have time to browse around for but that i vaguely remember.you may want to check out the papers on the adventist health study-2 cohort . there are so many studies within this cohort that finds diet is the factor responsible for lower rates of diabetes , some cancers , lower body weights , etc . all of these videos on adventist may also help explain.why , if you believe in a paleo based diet , do you spend so much time going to alternative sites to argue with them ? i am not trying to be hostile or anything ; i am just curious.i find the scientific evidence offered by dr. greger very helpful for my lifestyle choices . what do you find here that supports your day to day life ? thanks ! dr. greger , i have a question . i have been following a low-fat , whole-food , plant-based lifestyle for 4 years . i am now a consultant for the lifestyle and have my own business : attainable wellness . i have also been using liquid aminos for seasoning on a daily basis . liquid aminos have leucine and methionine as well as other amino acids that are derived from soy beans . after reading your article i wonder if liquid aminos are healthy ? could you share your opinion ? i don â t want to lead myself or my clients astray.thank you so much , sherry pattersonattainable wellnesshttp : / / www.attainablewellnessinc.comsherry @ attainablewellnessinc.coman oldie but useful . is msg bad for you ? . keep in mind there is less than a half a gram of protein in liquid aminos . i am not advocating it , but if you like the taste i see no reason to avoid based on the animo acids content.it might be interesting to note that soy protein isolates are very high in leucine ( http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / foods-000082000000000000000.html ) â¦ but as previously noted ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / how-much-soy-is-too-much / ) 3-5 servings of ( whole ) soy is better for you . looks like those transitional â vegan faux-meats â based on tvp may not be a â safe â alternative afterall.i wonder if leucine from plant sources is any different than leucine from animal sources ? â¦ some of the top foods with high leucine levels are from plants : soy protein isolate , spirulina and watercress ! : - ( good points ! please see my comments below in this thread . it may help explain your two recent questions . thanks.there â re only two types of leucine : l-leucine and d-leucine . plants and animals contain only l-leucine , so the leucine vegans get from food and that omnivorous do are one and the same : l-leucine.what are your thoughts on liquid aminos as a seasoning . they contain leucine and methionine derived from soy beans.please see my comments below to sherry . thanks , unless this is sherry from another account , in which case please see my reply to your original comment : - ) â to reach the leucine intake provided by dairy or meat , we â d have to eat nine pounds of cabbage â about four big heads â or 100 apples . â i â m just wondering if the nine pounds of cabbage would relate to , say , a cup of yogurt . â or maybe a half cup . or three cups . in other words , how big a portion of animal protein are we talking ? according to cronometer.com , 9 lb of cooked green cabbage contains 1.7g of leucine . the same amount is contained in 1.3 cups of plain , lowfat yogurt.i am 65 years old and my arms â the skin of my arms â has become ultra sensitive . i am a passionate vegan and i would never go back on this one ; however , every single time i show what happens to my skin in my arms â that is the only part of my skin where it happens â they tell me immediately that the problem comes from not eating enough â animal protein â . let me explain what happens : a little heavier pressure on the skin of my arms causes the capillary vessels to explode and bathe with blood a vast region . eventually it all goes back to normal . my mother was not vega at all and she had the same weakness ; so , it has to be some sort of genetical trend , or is it ? what would the advice be ? i â m not sure how animal protein would â fix â the problem . you could try and see if there is a difference ? we have many videos on skin health . protein , vitamins , and minerals are important for generating new growth of skin , hair and nails . so long as these nutrients are adequate i would expect proper growth . have you seen a dermatologist ? what did your doctor recommend ? did you check your bleeding , prothrombin , and coagulation times ? i see that soy foods and nuts and seeds , even beans are high in leucine . should one avoid them too ? what is the leucine content of nuts and seeds . should they be restricted.i understand that some plan foods are high in methionine , like sesame seeds . would you recommend limiting these foods ? i eat a whole food plant-based diet since my breast cancer diagnosis and i was wondering if i should limit my consumption of tahini.good question , cecile , and i see that nobody â s responded . in addition to methionine and leucine , other amino acids may be troublesome : arginine also appears to stimulate mtor signaling and many cancers thrive on glutamine . as for sesame seeds , they also contain a fairly significant amount of copper , which stimulates angiogenesis . as a cancer survivor , i opt for following the precautionary principle â and have eliminated sesame seed paste . according to the nutritiondata website , chia seems to be a healthy alternative . compared to other common seeds , it â s lower in glutamic acid and very low in methionine.speaking of the okinawans , you profiled a study a ways back talking about the benefits of the sweet potato , as far as undigested proteins of s.p. having positive effect , but is there also a negative effect as far as undigested proteins circulating the body , causing immune or gut issues ? i â ve always heard that undigested proteins can be a bad thing as well . thoughts on this , dr. g ? thanks.i am wondering which study you are referring to . one of the reasons i quit taking ppis for acid reflux was the issue of undigested proteins causing allergies . so this sounds odd to me but i have not seen the video.dr. greger did a video highlighting the benefits of sweet potatoes , and he said that parts of the sweet potato proteins remaining undigested are what created these said benefits . so yeah , for some folks maybe undigested proteins do not cause harm but i am wondering if this applies to the sweet potatoes as well.i got a little confused . here lucene shortens my life. but in every bodybuilding guidebook it â s one of the essential aminos that every sportsman should take . even they claim it is good that it activates mtor . i had read that 5- ' 10mg a day is essential to gain muscle . where s the middle ? here are some protein recommendations . in the last link of this blog dr. greger mentions how plant protein is preferable . it â s hard to say exactly how much protein to restrict to suppress tor . the recommendations for protein intake vary from 10-35 % of total calories . the tradition okinawan diet is only about 10 % protein , so perhaps the lower end of that range ( 10-35 % ) is preferred . the low end of protein recommendations are between 0.8-0.9g / kg for adults . after 65 years old , based on this study i would suggest bumping up these recommendations . for athletes now we â re talking a new ballgame . i talk about that further down in the thread about protein needs , of course they can vary depending on individual needs.don â t know if this will help anyone â s fears or not , but i looked up leucene amounts for 1 cup of a few foods that people might easily / naturally eat a cup of at one time â on the nutrtionself.com website : chicken : 2827 mg pinto beans : 1308 mg quinoa : 483 mg brown rice : 372 mg broccoli : 230 mgso , even though beans are higher in leucine than say brocooli , beans still have * significantly * less leucine than say chicken . given the abundance of evidence we have on the benefits of beans ( check out : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = beans ) , i say , â pass me some beans , please ! â sources : chicken : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / poultry-products / 700 / 2 bean : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / legumes-and-legume-products / 4312 / 2 brown rice : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / cereal-grains-and-pasta /

2what about soy protein from tofu or tempeh ? you mention vegetables and beans , but not soy products.we mention tofu and tempeh in our soy section.however , some other studies show that supplementing leucine extends lifespan in mice.even though the results of the study , published in the journal cell metabolism , are based on animal studies , they hold a lot of promise especially in our efforts to keep old age at bay.in the study , dr. enzo nisoli , of the university of milan gave mice drinking water laced with three amino acids â leucine , isoleunic and valine . at the end of the study , the mice receiving the amino-acid cocktail extended their lifespan by 12 per cent compared to the control group receiving ordinary water.small typo : â it a long â should probably be â it has a long â as an athlete i know that leucine is probably the most important amino acid for anabolic response , and proteins are as good s their leucine content , so if i want to be stronger and build muscle , dont i need plenty of leucine ? alas , mtor is responsible for some anabolism ( and in the hypothalamus , satiety ) , but also suppresses catabolic processes like autophagy that confer protection against aging related diseases . there may be a fundamental downside to depending on leucine for anabolic response and weight loss.there is a bright side : while protein restricted animals live longer , and leucine related mtor inhibition appears to account for some of this , most of the benefit of protein restriction is captured in experiments that just restrict methionine . excess methionine appears harmful by an different mechanism , increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and ros production.so , there â s the option of attempting to maximize benefits from higher leucine intake while minimizing excess methionine ( and probably cysteine , which spares methionine requirements ) . foods with high leu / ( met + cys ) include most legumes ( avg 3.2 ) , azuki beans ( 4.2 ) , kidney beans ( 3.8 ) , , peas in pod ( 5.3 ) , almonds ( 4.0 ) , corn ( 3.7 ) , green peas ( 2.8 ) with soy at ( 2.7 ) . for comparison , whey â s ratio is 2.2 and egg whites are 1.5 , so for a given amount of leucine kidney beans would provide only 40 % the met + cys load . there â s also the strong possibility in the literature that two conditionally-essential amino acids , glycine and serine , may mimic methionine restriction , and many of the same foods rate highly for gly + ser / met + cys content . i like glycine as a bedtime hibiscus tea sweetener.could you explain how cysteine â spares methionine requirements â ? and where â s the evidence for serine ? speaking of amino acids , i â ve also read that arginine stimulates mtor signaling http : / / www.mdpi.com / 1422-0067 / 12 / 1 / 506 / htm and that many cancers thrive on glutamine. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2917518 / comments ? you â re always so insightful.what would you ( and everybody else ) say about the links ( below ) i came across some time ago ? â cancer cells require the amino acids glycine , glutamic acid , aspartic acid , and serine to synthesize dna , build new blood vessels , and duplicate their entire protein contents . they also require these and certain other amino acids to synthesize other proteins that act as growth-promoting hormones or tumor growth factors . the controlled amino acid formula impairs the synthesis of a protein called elastin , which is absolutely essential to the manufacture of new blood vessels . â â https : / / www.apjohncancerinstitute.org / caat-protocol â this led to the identification of glycine â a non-essential amino acid â as a metabolite that is consumed by rapidly growing cancer cells and released by slow-growing cancer cells . glycine is endogenously produced in both the cytosol and mitochondria ; using genetic profiling , the authors determined that transformed cells have an increased reliance on either exogenous glycine or glycine produced by the mitochondrial pathway . â â http : / / dmm.biologists.org / content / 5 / 4 / 415.3.full â one of the most striking results of the new data is how the pattern of glycine consumption relates to the speed of cancer-cell division . in the slowest dividing cells , small amounts of glyine are released into the culture media . but in cancer cells that are rapidly dividing , glycine is rapaciously consumed . the researchers note that very few metabolites have this unusual pattern of â crossing the zero line , â meaning that rapidly dividing cancer cells consume the metabolite while slowly dividing cells actually release it . â http : / / www.sciencedaily.com / releases / 2012 / 05 / 120524143446.htm â not all cancers show up on fdg pet scans , and that could be because some use glutamine metabolism rather than glycolysis . or they could depend on still another nutrient , the amino acid glycine . a may 2012 article in science found that , in a study of 1,300 samples of tumors from early-stage breast cancer patients , those whose tumors had higher levels of glycine synthesis were more likely to die from the disease.researchers know very little about how the body regulates glycine metabolism . yet its contribution to tumor cell proliferation only increases the evidence that changes in metabolism are a cause of cancer and not just a consequence . â â http : / / protomag.com / assets / cutting-cancers-power ? page = 1on the other hand , it seems dietary glycine might have opposite effects ? â¦ glycine as a potent anti-angiogenic nutrient for tumor growth â dietary glycine prevents the development of liver tumors caused by the peroxisome proliferator wy-14,643 â dietary glycine inhibits the growth of b16 melanoma tumors in miceisn â t this just another case of getting lost in the reductionist thinking ? which doesn â t seem very healthy . do this one thing for longer life . there is no one magic bullet , folks.artcomm : citrus bioflavanoids , which are found in the white parts of the rinds of oranges and lemons , strengthens the capillaries . or in other words , decreases their fragility . just a fyi.i love dr gregor and dutifully follow all his suggestions but i have to object to his charactorization of calorie restriction as a diet with constant hunger , many emotional and psychological issues , etc . the minnesota starvation study is esp unfair as a basis for evaluating cr . i believe it is the study conducted during wwii using soldiers or consciencious objectors who were forced to participate in the study . why not use research conducted in the last 20 years with willing participants who are committed to cr ? like me . i have practiced a vegan , cr lifestyle since 1998 and have done fine with it . i reduced my calories to 1800 ( i was formerly eating about 2200 ) . i was hungry for the first year , at times , during the day until my weight went very slowly ( less than a pound per 2 weeks ) down to my college weight , my body reached some kind of equilibrium and i stopped losing weight . i checked out my diet with a nutrition database to make sure that i was get adequate nutrition . since i was eating 11 servings of veg / fruit a day with plenty of legumes and nuts , my nutrient intake was outstanding including 50 grams of fiber and 60 grams of veg protein . my bio markers are fine including 149 total cholesterol , 78 ldl and 120 / 70 or lower blood pressure . 1800 calories of vegan food , as long as you exclude the usual vegan snacks like chips , sports bars , etc is really an enormous amount of veg / fruit / legumes and hunger is not an issue . most cr people , including those who eat animal protein , are actually eating a near vegan diet to to the enormous value placed on vegetable , fruit and legumes.these are all healthy foods . as joseph gonzales has mentioned above , leucine ( and also methionine , btw ) is an essential amino acid , and it needs to be consumed . while you shouldn â t be swimming in whey protein shakes ( whey protein is very high in leucine ) , a well-rounded plant-based diet is highly unlikely to result in a detrimental level of leucine , methionine , or any other animo acid . you â re certainly not cutting your life short by eating soybeans , lentils , peanuts , almonds , and walnuts â unless that â s the full extent of your daily diet.aventist study 2 result say that vegan live shortter lives than those who eat fish.not really . the mortality rates weren â t significantly distinguishable ( the mean for each cohort fell within the 95 % confidence interval of the other ) . however as ahs 2 is an ongoing study , we can expect those confidence intervals to narrow considerably . adventist health studies , aging , animal products , animal protein , apples , beans , cabbage , california , caloric restriction , chicken , china study

            "Query PLAIN-22: why are cancer rates so low in india ? it is estimated that many tumors start around the age of 20 . however , detection of cancer is normally around the age of 50 or later . thus , it takes cancer decades to incubate . why does it take so long ? recent studies indicate that in any given type of cancer , hundreds of different genes must be modified to change a normal cell into a cancer cell . although cancers are characterized by the dysregulation of cell signaling pathways at multiple steps , most current anticancer therapies involve the modulation of a single target . chemotherapy has gotten incredibly specific , but the ineffectiveness , lack of safety , and high cost of these monotargeted therapies has led to real disappointment , and drug companies are now trying to develop chemo drugs that take a multitargeted approach . many plant-based products , however , accomplish multitargeting naturally and are inexpensive and safe compared to drugs . however , because drug companies are not usually able to secure intellectual property rights to plants , the development of plant-based anticancer therapies has not been prioritized . they may work ( and work better for all we know ) , and they may be safer , or even fully risk free . if we were going to choose one plant-based product to start testing , we might choose curcumin , the pigment in the spice turmeric ( the reason curry powder looks yellow ) . before we start throwing money at research , we might want to ask some basic questions , like â do populations that eat a lot of turmeric have lower cancer rates ? â the incidence of cancer does appear to be significantly lower in regions where turmeric is heavily consumed . population-based data indicate that some extremely common cancers in the western world are much less prevalent in regions where turmeric is widely consumed in the diet . for example , â overall cancer rates are much lower in india than in western countries . â u.s. men get 23 times more prostate cancer than men in india . americans get between 8 and 14 times the rate of melanoma , 10 to 11 times more colorectal cancer , 9 times more endometrial cancer , 7 to 17 times more lung cancer , 7 to 8 times more bladder cancer , 5 times more breast cancer , and 9 to 12 times more kidney cancer . this is not mere 5 , 10 , or 20 percent more , but 5 , 10 , or 20 times more . hundreds of percent more breast cancer , thousands of percent more prostate cancer â differences even greater than some of those found in the china study . the researchers in this study , highlighted in my video back to our roots : curry and cancer , conclude : â because indians account for one-sixth of the world â s population , and have some of the highest spice consumption in the world , epidemiological studies in this country have great potential for improving our understanding of the relationship between diet and cancer . the lower rates of cancer may , of course , not be due to higher spice intake . several dietary factors may contribute to the low overall rate of cancer in india . among them are a â relatively low intake of meat and a mostly plant-based diet , in addition to the high intake of spices . â forty percent of indians are vegetarians , and even the ones that do eat meat don â t eat a lot . and it â s not only what they don â t eat , but what they do . india is one of the largest producers and consumers of fresh fruits and vegetables , and indians eat a lot of pulses ( legumes ) , such as beans , chickpeas , and lentils . they also eat a wide variety of spices in addition to turmeric that constitute , by weight , the most antioxidant-packed class of foods in the world . population studies can â t prove a correlation between dietary turmeric and decreased cancer risk , but they can certainly inspire a bunch of research . so far , curcumin has been tested against a variety of human cancers , including colorectal cancer , pancreatic cancer , breast , prostate , multiple myeloma , lung cancer , and head and neck cancer , for both prevention and treatment . for more information on turmeric and curcumin , check out carcinogen blocking effects of turmeric curcumin and turmeric curcumin reprogramming cancer cell death . i â m working on another dozen or so videos on this amazing spice . this is what i have so far : amla , dried indian gooseberry powder , is another promising dietary addition : i add amla to my pink juice with green foam recipe . not all natural products from india are safe , though . see , for example , my video some ayurvedic medicine worse than lead paint exposure . more on the antioxidant concentration in spices in general in antioxidants in a pinch . why do antioxidants matter ? see food antioxidants and cancer and food antioxidants , stroke , and heart disease . which fruits and vegetables might be best ? see # 1 anticancer vegetable and best fruits for cancer prevention . i need to start cooking more indian food . it â s a good thing it â s so tasty . just remember guys , most indian restaurant food is loaded with butter and cream.very true . do you know if that is also the case in india ? i hear they eat alot of clarified butter . ( ghee ) ghee is definitely the preferred frying medium , but the day to day food is basically a simple dal , vegetable dish , and rice . the rich and creamy dishes are reserved for special occasions.you can make many indian dishes without â¦ they may not be precise , but they are close and very good â¦ this is true . i make both northern and southern dishes by roasting my spices in a dry pan instead of in oil . it all tastes delicious.this indian chef shows how oil free spice roasting is done. https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = xp8g4n5k3iqjustme : fun video ! thanks for the link.veganrunner : sounds like you got some knowledgeable answers to your actual question . i just wanted to share that pcrm â s 21 day kickstart program has an indian version , which is still in english , but all the recipes are indian ones . it is my understanding that those recipes were developed by natives . so , those recipes should be a way to make some reasonably authentic tasting indian food without the animal products . ( the 21 day kickstart program is free , though requires registration . ) just sharing in case you would be interested.thanks thea . the reason i was asking is because i have a patient who refuses to give ghee up . he is under the impression it is a health food . one of his indian friends told him so and he is sticking to it ! she also said to eat walnuts so it isn â t all bad advice . i was wondering if anyone knew of this tradition / belief . but i think brydon gave a good answer â â used for special occasions . â veganrunner : very interesting . this is the second time in a relatively short time where i have heard of someone who has seriously taken health advice from someone who isn â t qualified . the other person was swearing by what her masseuse told her . : -oas you say , you already have an answer . but i was wondering if maybe the following would also help ? this short jeff novick video doesn â t mention ghee , but the same principle would apply . of course , your patient may not be able to make the connection â¦ https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = lbalgjmzuek & feature = fvwrelgood luck with your patient.i am indian pharmacologist and try answering some questions . yes indians use lot of spice in food . turmeric is traditional and compulsion in many foods . turmeric is an hall mark to be used in all sacred occasions . in marriage it is used on bride / groom face . many events of day involves turmeric.coming to ghee . yes consumption of ghee is extremely good for health . but the ghee what we are suppose to use is clarified butter extracted from butter milk and not from the milk solids . now by research it is known that butter can slim you down and we believe ghee also should.if any recipe is required please do ask ramesh000 @ yahoo.com @ veganrunner : disqusyou can replace ghee in most indian dishes with coconut milk or coconut oil . i know , coconut oil and milk are bad too but probably not as bad as ghee , which is even worse than butter.milk is very bad i agree , but coconut oil is extremely good for brain and antimicrobial . it keeps you slim . try putting on wt by using oil . you fail totally and become slim.brydon10 : here â s a recipe for you to get started : tofu paneer bhurji . the recipe was recently featured in pcrm â s recipe of the week . i haven â t made it yet myself , but it looks really , really good and i have vowed to give it a try . if you try it first , let us know what you think. http : / / support.pcrm.org / site / messageviewer ?

) . anything to emphasize your comments are far from a typical blog entry.i think it would be hard to number references because he links to other videos , which of course have ample citations . we can still click the hyperlinks and see the individual references : - ) thanks for your kind words ! i agree , â anything to emphasize your comments are far from a typical blog entry . â excellent post ! i â m moving in with an indian family in a few months and will have to learn to love spicy food . ( leaving out the ghee , of course ! ) very helpful information about curcumin . what is the best and reliable place to buy curcumin ? i would suggest the turmeric spice , either fresh root or powder , rather than curcumin capsules . i â m not sure a reliable curcumin supplement , but perhaps others have more experience and can weigh-in ? joseph , do you know anything of liquid turmeric ? it is sold here in australia in health food shops.i don â t , sorry . i go for the powder and sometimes the root . one time i juiced the root and my juicer turned yellow . true ( uneventful ) story . good luck ! thank you joseph i will try the fresh root of turmeric spice . if you have any reliable place to buy , please let me know : ) any grocery store should do : - ) thank you joseph : ) it is just difficult to trust in any source of real ingredients ! but i will still keep checking at mountain rose herbs â web sitea good place to buy bulk herbs and spices , etc online is mountain rose herbs . they actively work to protect and preserve the earth . they are dedicated to sustainable business practices and support small organic farms around the world , as well as efforts to protect our wild lands.i just checked the web site but they are out of stock of turmeric root . if you have any other suggestion please let me know.i don â t know where you are based , but i find fresh turmeric root in both chinese , indian and asian food stores.just this morning i saw fresh turmeric root at sprouts market but it was expensive . the turmeric powder i use these days is from a company called terrasoul . it â s organic and i â m very happy with the product . i bought it online directly from the company but it â s available at amazon , too . i â ve used other organic turmeric brands from amazon and they â re all pretty good , too . one has to be careful buying turmeric , or any other spice , from indian stores because 1 ) the spices are not organic 2 ) the turnover is low , which affects the freshness . good turmeric powder has a bright color between orange and yellow ( saffron , amber ? ) . if it â s pale yellow , it â s best days are behind it . ( i â m from that part of the world and have been eating turmeric all my life , so i â m pretty familiar with it . ) sorry , are we talking about the same country ? .. https : / / nitawriter.wordpress.com / 2007 / 04 / 26 / india-has-one-of-the-highest-cancer-rates-in-the-world / according to the stats in that , india has , overall , one of the highest rates of cancer in the world . i seriously don â t know if i can trust this website for unbiased information . it seems as though whenever a new video comes out and you double check the facts , it becomes evident that what we are actually dealing with is a thinly disguised springboard for either preaching veganism or having a bash at â animal products â . i can â t think of much in india that we can be proud of in terms of nutrition.and how ironic that india , of all countries in the world , should be looked at through vegan tinted specs , in order to say something positive about either vegetarianism or veganism.there are nationwide deficiencies of iron http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25614831 , b12 , choline and even d3 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25883424.none of this would be so if they had regular access to clean animal foods http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 24866058 that supply these nutrients . and please remember that ghandi himself tried to live off a vegan diet with his followers , but later concluded that it was detrimental to their health ( which of course it is . they drank some milk to correct , at least partially , the imbalance ) we should , with heads hung low in shame , remember that in india there is an epidemic of b12 deficiency that has crippled the nations health . millions of children are born with massively impaired cognitive function , often because of the parents stubborn refusal to eat foods of â animal â origin . are we contributing to this gross misinformation ? this website claims to be impartial and yet will not address such real burning issues amonst this poor population of people ; and that , just for the sake of upholding a religious ideology ( i.e â veganism â ) .come on folks , this is peoples lives we are dealing with here . remember that the possibility that â a large percentage may have a subclinical vitamin deficiency are not simply theoretical within populations in india â http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 74 / 2 / 157.full and , â it has been known for > 3 decades that vegetarians in india have lower serum cobalamin concentrations than do nonvegetarians , with the lowest concentrations being in vegans â this is not some wacky study looking at correlation .. we are talking about the hard science of nutrition , which does not respect our ideologies . so how does the b12 factor influence cancer ? in numerous ways : if indian women could only get their b12 levels up ( even if it were just from a few glasses of clean , raw milk if they had issues with â meat â ) they would massively reduce their risk of cervical cancer http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2971743 / .that is just one example.but remember that cancer aside briefly , 60 % of indian women are aenimic .. pray , what is that to be proud of ? will curcumin sort that out ? and more importantly , how would vegetarian foods help these poor women ? a half of all kids under the age of 4 are malnourished â¦ .plant foods to the rescue ? get real people.no plant foods are going to supply the b12 , d3 , retinol or omega 3 etc that are among the most common nutritional deficiancies found with the indian populations http : / / www.thehealthsite.com / news / national-nutrition-week-2014-top-nutritional-deficiencies-in-india / . we just need honest people to acknowledge this.gunter73 the reference you site reports 7 lakhs indians will be diagnosed with cancer in 2015 . 7 lakhs in case you do not know is 700,000. that is out of population of 1,200,000,000.in us according to 2012 report 13 million people were living with cancer . 13 million is 130 lakhs out of population which is 1 / 6th of indian population.hi g-man , be that as it may , i still don â t think we have a lot to celebrate about the health of the indian nation ; that is why i broght up the issue of malnourishment .. it is an absolute epidemic , and one which saddens us . we desparately need practical solutions to this problem.did you read the articles that you referenced ? it talked about the difference between traditional india and now . traditionally , india had very low rates of cancer , but with all their gmo and pesticide laden farms now , things seem to be changing . it does not seem that you are interested in finding out about what could make sense here , but rather , trying to create conflict with dr. greger . i don â t find your post informative or interesting , just creating conflict for its own sake . do you really think that india isn â t the land of most sophisticated and greatest use of spices for health ? then who is ? john s pdx orhi john , i personally love indian cuisine more than any other in the world ( ! ) .. not only that but years of personal involvement with indians has given me a great soft spot for them .. that was the reason for my post . when we have all â said our bit â those issues i raised are still there .. and they make me sad . and no doubt they do with you as well . india has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world . not , i believe , primarily because of diet . but certainly diet has played a role . john , i love all those spices and am fully aware of their healing power .. but my point is that they wont address the harcore nutritional deficiency problems that the indain people suffer , simply because the spices wont supply the body with those nutrients.india is one of the few countries in the world where compassion and mercy for animals is actually part of the mainstream culture , i can â t see why anyone would want to reverse this and contribute to the horrible stain on humanity that is industrial animal agriculture . if there is a nationwide b12 deficiency as you say , the obvious solution would be to have the government mandate fortification of common foods with b12 rather than convince poor people to go against their religious / ethical beliefs and buy food that they likely can â t afford anyway . as for iron , there are plenty of plant sources of iron , it â s a matter of educating people on how to obtain enough . remember that anemia is common among women even in western countries where they are eating loads of meat . d3 can be obtained from sunlight , my guess is that more people are doing office jobs now so don â t go out enough during the day so this is also a matter of education.you said â india is one of the few countries in the world where compassion and mercy for animals is actually part of the mainstream culture â well perhaps keeps in the culture , but things are pretty ugly now : â india has been the largest exporter of beef in the world since last year , and has further widened its lead over second-ranked brazil with a projected total of 2.4 million tons exported in 2015 against brazil â s 2 million.the usda report , released earlier this month , predicts that global beef exports overall will rise to a record 10.2 million tons , 3 % higher than the october 2014 forecast.beef has also overtaken basmati rice as india â s largest agricultural food export in terms of value , according to data from the country â s agricultural and processed food products â export development authority , cited by the economic times newspaper.although the slaughter of cows , sacred for the hindus that make up india â s majority population , has long been banned in several parts of the country , states like maharashtra â one of its largest â recently expanded the ban to include bulls and bullocks as well . however , since india â s exports are composed entirely of water-buffalo meat or carabeef , the bans will not affect the figures cited in the report . â http : / / time.com / 3833931 / india-beef-exports-rise-ban-buffalo-meat / hi doug , i take your point about the fortification and thanks for attempting to address the issue with a cool head ( ! ) i think the people of india , just as anywhere else , have the right to choose for themselves . some of them refuse to eat any animal products and for them the fortification idea is certainly a solution . for the vegetarians who drink milk for a food source of b12 , that milk shoul be made available and should be clean ( an aside , i dont personally drink milk ) . i would never suggest that they should eat anything against their conscience , but that would also include a purely plant-based diet.you must get a good workout jumping to conclusions , huh ? nutrition facts , not vegan facts â¦ get it ? veganism is some arbitrary cult that abducted you against your will to elucidate us poor malnourished souls ? so you â re here to inform us that eating a plant based diet is somehow deficient ? did you even read the articles you so magnanimously provided because you missed some critical info â¦ as others already stated . what is your agenda ? try another website , this one is based on science , not your personal belief that killing animals is a need to feed you ! what do you think the animals you favor for your dinner eat , to grow up to be on your precious plate ? plants â¦ oh how does bessie manage ? ? ? and milk ? spare me ! unless you are a baby cow sir , why would you suck on cow â s milk ? human milk is for human babies , and contains the right proportion of nutrients for them . cow â s milk exists to make a calf grow into a half ton cow in a year â¦ not a healthy goal for people , not to mention the foreign proteins that confound our biochemistry and cause many health issues . once any animal is weaned , milk is not necessary . just because we can , doesn â t mean we should . so i gotta ask , are you an infant or a calf â¦ based on your sarcastic rant it â s hard to guess . by the way , b12 is made by soil bacteria , not animals . it would do anyone well to take some supplementation , since we have depleted the soil and have become so anal about a speck of it on our produce anyway , and even cows don â t get to graze the earth since they are forced to eat the crap the factory farms feed them . ( as if they don â t stand in enough of their own all day ) instead of their natural diet of grass they are forced to ingest cheap chemical laden grains , other dead animals , antibiotics to keep them alive under grotesque conditions , and other unsuitable slop , and their flesh concentrates all the other pollutants you so enjoy . yumm , chow down ! or do you prefer â free range â instead ? lol , yeah , that â s sustainable , great option . not a possibility when we have more cows than people nor the land to sustain them . or piggies . or chickens . ( and all those lovely by-products ) . when you see one of those animals , do you start salivating , chase after them at high speed , crush their neck in your pointy snout and vicious canines , and rip out their bloody innards with your sharp claws like any other carnivore ? and digest it in your highly acidic stomach and exceptionally short carnivore intestine so it doesn â t putrefy like in us biologically herbivorous humans ? or maybe you are merely an omnivore , like a bear , or a racoon , or a skunk . oh wait , they have pointy snouts , sharp teeth and vicious claws too â¦ hmmm . do you have a picture to share ? eating animals is what advanced our brain growth and allowed us to evolve from apes into smart folks like you , right ? yep , just like all those other omnivores and carnivores â¦ gee , what hampered their brains , eating all that meat ? maybe they never learned to harness fire and cook so they could get more nutrients for brain growth ? so â prey â , what is your â deficiency â that you are compelled to spew your â anemic â ideology here ? â honest people â can deal with the truth without bending reality to suit their personal tastes and preferences . many of us have experienced first hand the healing effects of an appropriate diet in the return of health and shedding of disease , it speaks for itself quite clearly if you aren â t into denial . forcing your biased and slanted opinions down the throats of those who know better prompts me to offer you some more real science , outside of this â preachy â â animal product bashing â one , to sink your frightful canines into â¦ https : / / www.scribd.com / doc / 94656 / the-comparative-anatomy-of-eating http : / / plantpositive.com / http : / / www.pcrm.org / http : / / www.onegreenplanet.org / lifestyle / the-vegan-diet-backed-by-science / http : / / www.nih.gov / researchmatters / june2013 / 06102013vegetarian.htm http : / / www.theatlantic.com / health / archive / 2012 / 01 / the-evidence-for-a-vegan-diet / 251498 / http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / natural.html https : / / www.forksoverknives.com / contributors / rip-esselstyn / https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / http : / / www.dresselstyn.com / site / plant-based-nutrition / http : / / nutritionstudies.org / http : / / doctorklaper.com / http : / / foodrevolution.org / sorry charzie but you â re reply is just too overweaning . you have failed to address even one of the issues i raised in what i wrote . they are real issues involving real people that call for real solutions beyond eating a handfull of soil.and seeing as you took it on yourself to remind me that this website is concerned with â science â , why did you not reply to my post with cool-headed scientific answers ? as it is you have simply resorted to borderline insult accompanied with a seething rage .. but all that aside there are some things you mentioned that i would like to address .. first up , i did not say that a plant-based diet cannot cure disease : it can . but lacking any clinical experience , you seem to assume that a plant-based diet will cure the spectrum of diseases that are all connected with b12 deficiency . even dr gregor himself will tell you that is simply not true . there is such an epidemic in india . how do you suggest this be dealt with ? the reason i mentioned milk is that many indians who dont eat meat drink milk because it contains a modest amount of vitamin b12 .. if they choose , for whatever reason , not to eat meat or drink milk they run the risk of developing one of the b12 deficiency diseases . i think a five year old can work that out . the basic problem with your approach to health and nutrition is that issues such as â sustainability â and â animal welfare â and the likes are a separate issue . i dont actually disagree with you on those issues , but they are separate from a discussion of say retinol or d3 or b12 .. the issues i broght up in my post which you failed to address . this â fudging â of human health with environmental issues forces people to become dishonest . i guarantee that if you listen to dr essylstyn or dr macdougall or one of the other â plant-based â doctors speak for more than an hour , they will all at some point in their talk / lecture bring up environmental issues .. they are two totally different issues.if i was overweening , i was just mirroring your haughty , opinionated , diatribe . you know what they say about opinions â¦ i â ve been adding whole frozen amla ( indian gooseberries ) to my breakfast oatmeal , purchased at my local indian grocery . would the frozen fruit possibly be subject to heavy metal contamination ? ? if dr. greger regularly eats powdered amla , can i assume the gooseberry component of triphala , which he warns against , is safe ? dr. greger initially praised triphala due to its impressive antioxidant capacity but later withdrew his recommendation based on the presence of various contaminants in some of the samples tested . banyon botanicals sells all manner of ayurvedic products . i questioned them re : this issue . they responded by reciting the testing and quality control measures that they employ which are documented on their website . i was satisfied with their response and have been purchasing triphala as well as tulsi and hingvastak from them.my bigger question is : can we trust the produce , frozen produce , and dried spices â imported from india â available at most indian groceries ? cathy : the only safest â or least unsafe â way to buy anything grown in india is to buy organic products imported by a reputable us company . if the frozen amla you use is not organic , i think using them is taking a chance . psychmd mentioned banyon botanicals . another good company is organic india . i take triphala tablets made by planetary herbals.listing countires by life expectancy , india ranks # 150 out of # 193 countries , near the bottom of the list ( but they don â t get cancer ) . i â ve lived in india and the average indian is in very poor health ( but they don â t get cancer ) . the grass isn â t always greener on the â other side â .you must take into account that in a lot of india ( countryside areas ) the living conditions are the ones of a third world country , sanitation is terrible , what would you expect ? i don â t think that even the cities there fare much better . similarly , some countries in africa part of the population have healthier diets than in western countries , yet their life expectancy is not surprisingly , what you would expect from third world countries.now india is changing as it follows western diet . all times meat , soft drinks , medicine for small health problem etc.india has become poor country , because politicians are stashing trillions of $ by corruption . when there is lack of justice , poor finance , diet always takes a hit . to use knowledge they need moneyreference : world health organizationhttp : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / list _ of _ countries _ by _ life _ expectancythe life expectancy in india is only 65 . are they just dying of something else before they have a chance to get cancer ?

also does taking the tumor it as a capsule work just as well ? we in india seeing cancer rate is steadily increase in the past 5 years â¦ every one is using white polished rice rice â¦ lot of refined oil â¦ meat intake is on rise â¦ . spices which they use are highly adulterated â¦ its all globalization invasion in every country â¦ .. http : / / www.xulonzoe.org health retreat center â¦ however , hepatitis & diabetes are high up there â why ? â americans get between 8 and 14 times the rate of melanoma â anybody stop to think whether the dramatically higher levels of melanin in the average indian â s skin might have something to do with this ? ? i am truly believe that plan base diet it â s best treatment for cancer , i got diagnosed stage 2 b breast cancer in nov . 2013 . i â m only 32 at that time , i was scared ï¼ my little girl only 2 month old . i starting to search best treatment for cancer and then i found dr. greger . learned a lot . i rejected chemo and radiation . start to cut meat little by little , around august 2014 , after i finished 3 times surgery , i became a vegan and i feel better and better and better every day . i didn â t take any drugs , my treatment just eat healthy and do exercise that â s all . my doctors are worried , but all the test results are showing i â m fine , i â m cancer free . and i feel really good , i don â t feel any sickness at all . right now i am back to normal , back to my old job , work full time , with two kids , life is good . i â ll keep my healthy lifestyle for my rest of my life , because it works , and i believe i have many many years to come . god bless everyone ! jojo : thanks for sharing your story . i can just imagine how scared you were . congratulations on being cancer free . i hope it continues that way for the rest of your life . and congratulations on eating a healthy diet . that can be a hard change for some people to make , even with a health condition . but you did it . you should be proud.what brand ( s ) of amla do you use in your pink drink so as to avoid contamination with toxic heavy metals ? thanks for the great service you provide , dr. gregeri cannot recommend a specific brand , but perhaps others using it and can give there take ? carl : while i can â t make any assertions myself , lots of people swear by the company , mountain rose herbs , as a great source for trust-worthy herbs / powders / teas etc . here are their amla selections. https : / / www.mountainroseherbs.com / search ? page = 1 & q = amla & utf8 = % e2 % 9c % 93 sadly , the powder is currently out of stock . but you could ask them when they will get it in again . ( note : while they are out of the powdered one , they do have the dehydrated version for the same price . depending on how the dehydrated product ends up being , you might be able to just get that and grind it up yourself in a food processor . or maybe enjoy it better in the chunky form ? ? ? just an idea . ) empowering article â¦ thank you â¦ please consider adding â blogger â to your â add this â buttonin india yogurt and cheese and ghee ( butter ) are eaten regularly all of which dr gregor usually finds cause cancer ? aloha , from memory ( i â m in thailand now ) harvard u. wondering why vegetarians have a 70 % less chance of getting cancer decided to look into it : what were vegetarians doing or not doing as the case maybe . harvard researchers found that chlorophyll wraps itself around the mutagen and the cancerous cell was now too large to penetrate a healthy cell . so , your body just eliminates it . tamils are primarily vegetarians so it would be interesting to know if their cancer rates were even lower than non-tamil rates . ( much like the seven day adventists vs other christians . ) another factor with a plant based diet , especially one with a lot of â leafy green vegetables â , is the body â s ph goes into the alkaline range and this also suppresses cancers , viruses and spoors . ( acidic ph is just the opposite in creating an environment in which these mutagens thrive . ) indians also consume much less food than westerners â it â s a poor country . did the studies control for caloric restriction which has for many decades demonstrated similar effects ? â contaminated vegetarianism â of asian indian is fallacy . the true indian diet life style should be taken from rural india where stuff like ice cream , saturated fats and fried foods are not seen . it will be interesting study the prevalence of heart diseases in urban vs and rural indian population to reinforce this view . yes , typical indian diet comprises ghee and butter which is proved to be good for health particularly brain . honey , butter and ghee is often prescribed in ayurveda while recent studies have de-linked the saturated fats ( not trans-fats or artificial hydrogenated fats ) with heart diseases but they seem to be pronounced effect when viewed in conjunction with life style . hence a deductive inference about a particular food as bad of good seem to be inconclusive unless a holistic factors are taken for study which is highly unlikely in the present research studies. antioxidants , beans , bladder cancer , bladder health , breast cancer , breast health , cancer , cancer survival , chemotherapy , chickpeas , china study , colon cancer , curcumin , curry powder , endometrial cancer , fruit , india , industry influence , kidney cancer , kidney health , legumes , lentils , lung cancer , lung health , meat , medications , melanoma , men 's health , multiple myeloma , pancreatic cancer , plant-based diets , prostate cancer , prostate health , ranking foods , side effects , skin health , spices , turmeric , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians , women 's health - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-32: peeks behind the egg industry curtain the american egg board is a promotional marketing board appointed by the u.s. government whose mission is to â increase demand for egg and egg products on behalf of u.s. egg producers . â if an individual egg company wants to run an ad campaign , they can say pretty much whatever they want . but if an egg corporation wants to dip into the 10 million dollars the american egg board sets aside for advertising every year , because the board is overseen by the federal government , corporations are not allowed to lie with those funds . this leads to quite revealing exchanges between egg corporations that want to use that money and the usda on what egg companies can and cannot say about eggs . thanks to the freedom of information act i was able to get my hands on some of those emails . of course a lot of what i got were pages with nearly all of the text blacked out ( you can see these in my video , who says eggs aren â t healthy or safe ? ) . but i did find some illuminating correspondence . for example , one email shows an egg company trying to put out a brochure on healthy snacking for kids . but because of existing laws against false and misleading advertising , the head of the usda â s poultry research and promotion programs reminds the company that eggs or egg products cannot be couched as being healthy or nutritious . â the words nutritious and healthy carry certain connotations , and because eggs have the amount of cholesterol they do , plus the fact that they â re not low in fat , [ the words healthy and nutritious ] are problematic . â this is the united states department of agriculture saying this ! however , the usda official helpfully suggests , â i believe you can say something that â s just as strong if not stronger , that is â naturally nutrient-dense . â â why can we say eggs are nutrient-dense but not nutritious ? because there â s no legal definition of nutrient-dense . we can say twinkies and coca cola are nutrient dense , but legally , we can â t say something is nutritious unless it â s actually â¦ nutritious . for example , the egg industry wanted to run an ad calling eggs a nutritional powerhouse that aids in weight loss . the usda had to remind the industry that they can â t portray eggs as a diet food because of the fat and cholesterol content . in fact , eggs have nearly twice the calories of anything that can be called â low-calorie . â â nutritional powerhouse â can â t be used either . fine , the industry said , they â ll move to plan b , and headline the ad â egg-ceptional nutrition . â they couldn â t say that either because , again , given the saturated fat and cholesterol you can â t legally call eggs nutritious . so the headline ended up as , â find true satisfaction , â and instead of weight loss they had to go with â can reduce hunger . â the usda congratulated them on their cleverness . yes , a food that when eaten can reduce hunger â what a concept ! they can â t even say eggs are â relatively â low in calories . can â t say eggs are low in saturated fat â they â re not . can â t say they â re relatively low in fat , they â re not . can â t even call them a rich source of protein , because , according to the usda , they â re not . it â s illegal to advertise that eggs pack a nutritional wallop , or that they have a high nutritional content . eggs have so much cholesterol , we can â t even say they â contribute nutritionally . â can â t say eggs are â healthful , â certainly can â t say they â re â healthy . â can â t even say eggs contribute â healthful components . â since we can â t say eggs are a healthy start to the day , the usda suggests a â satisfying start . â egg corporations can â t call eggs a healthy ingredient , but they can call eggs a â recognizable â ingredient . can â t truthfully say eggs are good for us , either . by law , according to the usda , the egg industry â needs to steer clear of words like â healthy â or â nutritious . â â for a food to be labeled â healthy â under fda rules , it has to be low in saturated fat ( eggs fail that criteria ) and have less than 90mg of cholesterol per serving ( even half an egg fails that test ) . for the same reason we can â t tout ice cream for strong bones , we can â t say eggs are healthy because they exceed the threshold for cholesterol . egg corporations aren â t even allowed to say things like â eggs are an important part of a well balanced , healthy diet â on an egg carton because it would be considered misleading according to the usda â s national egg supervisor , since eggs contain significant amounts of fat and cholesterol and therefore can contribute to the leading killer in the united states , heart disease . the industry can â t afford to tell the truth about the eggs , or even the hens that lay them . the industry crams five to ten birds in cages the size of a file cabinet their whole lives , but when providing footage to the media , the american egg board instructs , â do not show multiple birds in cages â they look too crowded and open us up to activist criticism . â not only is the industry barred from saying eggs are healthy , they can â t even refer to eggs as safe because more than a hundred thousand americans are food poisoned by salmonella from eggs every year . the egg board â s response to this egg-borne epidemic is that salmonella is a naturally occurring bacterium . an internal egg industry memo didn â t think that should necessarily be the key message , fearing that â it may be counterproductive by implying there is no avoiding salmonella in eggs aside from avoiding eggs altogether . â the food poisoning risk is why the american egg board can â t even mention anything but eggs cooked hard and dry . no soft-boiled , no over-easy , no sunny-side up â because of the salmonella risk . the american egg board â s own research showed that the sunny-side up cooking method should be considered â unsafe . â in light of bird flu viruses , both the white and yolk must be cooked firm . the vp of marketing for the egg board complained to the usda saying they â d â really like to not have to dictate that the yolks are firm , â and cites a washington post article saying runny yolks may be safe for everyone except pregnant women , infants , elderly , or those with chronic disease . it turns out it was a misquote â eggs can â t be considered safe for anyone . instead of safe , they can call eggs â fresh , â the usda marketing service helpfully suggests . but they can â t call eggs safe , and they can â t say eggs are â safe to eat . â they can â t even mention safety at all . wait a second , not only can eggs not be called healthy they can â t even be called safe ? says who ? says the united states department of agriculture . for more peeks behind the egg industry curtain see : i think i â ll stick with tofu scrambleso , with this recent change in lowing concerns about cholesterol from what you eat , does this mean the eggs industry is going to make claims on health that they previously couldn â t ? or is this reduction in concern for dietary cholesterol just a political thing ? we â ll see what claims they start making . regardless , it seems the egg industry is being deceptive when it comes to public knowledge . cholesterol guidelines are a subject that many researchers are debating . dr. greger discuss optimal cholesterol levels , here.thanks. i have seen that video before , in fact just shortly before the announcement by national nutrition advisory panel that dietary cholesterol isn â t a concern . in fact that report really created a conflict at home where i was pointing out how bad eggs really were , and then they came out with a report that said they are fine . do we know what study ( s ) the advisory panel was relying on for their decision ? hey mikeonraw . glad you saw that video ! have you seen any of the communication from dr. greger testifying at the dgfa meetings ? it was just a few days back . this may help . i think he is at 2 : 06 : 00 . another speaker is dr. barnard who address the issue at hand . he is probably like 15 min before dr. greger . he addresses the aha / acc report directly and dr. greger follows-up on it . hope that helps ! thanks for your comments ! josephgo dr. greger ! thanks for the link to this testimony . also , thanks for pointing out the times that dr. barnard and dr. greger spoke . i would not have had the patience to find that myself.nope , didn â t see testify but i will check it out tonight . thanks for the follow ups.dr. barnard is at 1 : 46 . thanks again.yea what about egg white â¦ dr ornish oks them and has reversed cad with them in his first food group for reversal.does this include organic eggsperhaps . most studies fail to separate organic vs non-organic . they both probably have the same amount of cholesterol and saturated fat , as seen with grass-fed organic beef and conventional beef.don â t forget that just a few years ago the harvard physicians â study determined that that although infrequent egg consumption caused no detectable harm , eating just one egg a day would increase risk of both heart disease and all causes of mortality. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 18400720 in fact , there are thousands of other studies which say much the same thing , warning against regular consumption of eggs and cholesterol-bearing foods . how the nutritional advisory council can disregard all these studies and be so callously caviler with americans â health is beyond my comprehension . i â ll be maintaining my abstinence from animal products whether they or their sponsors in the food industry like it or not.what about egg whites ? yea what about egg white â¦ dr ornish oks them and has reversed cad with them in his first food group for reversal.egg whites don â t have cholesterol . they still have protein , but lack fiber and antioxidants . not sure exactly how their protein relates to increased risk of igf-i , but animal protein may increase igf-i production.explorer : i â m not sure if you would get notified of this or not , but i posted about egg whites separately on this page . there are lots of compelling reasons to stay away from egg whites.thanks thea . you can always right click on a comment ( on the time ) and copy link address . you probably know that as you have been here a while : ) either way is fine . i appreciate your input.joseph : no , i did not know that . i always wondered how people did that . thanks ! in the united states , the vast majority of soybeans , 87 percent , are genetically modified organisms , also known as gmos , according to gmo compass . gmo soy is also found in up to 70 percent of food products in u.s. supermarkets , including cereals , breads , soy milk , pasta and meat.have fun with your tofu â i â ll stick with pastured duck eggs.seems most tofu i find is organic , hence , not made with gmo soy.hi charles . there is lots of info on gmo and soy in this video , if interested.thanks for your comments ! josephi thought high cholesterol foods were no longer a problem ? not that i want to eat eggs , but i tend toward high cholesterol and i â m still confused about it , sorry ! if we don â t get high cholesterol from dietary cholesterol , as they now say , then how do we get it ? saturated fat ? is it just in our genes ? hi susan , cholesterol guidelines are a subject that many researchers are debating . we â ve known for a long time saturated fats boost cholesterol more than just dietary cholesterol . dr. greger discuss optimal cholesterol levels , here.in practically all poultry farms retroviruses , which are closely related to mouse mammary tumor retrovirus ( mmtv ) , can be found . laying hens have a high rate of ovarian tumors , but such tumors are uncommon in hens less than 2 years old . oviductal and ovarian tumors are generally not differentiated , and genital tumors occur mainly in hens above the age at which most are slaughtered . in commercial poultry operations , hens are usually sacrificed after their first year as layers , aged between 22 and 24 months . battery-egg laying hens attract retroviruses of mice on the grain stocks . eggs are therefore permanently infected . retrovirus secreting mice also come into contact with free-range chickens . free-range chickens are often kept outdoors so that the risk of contamination through the pollution of food on the ground may be greater from mice feces . in the winter months , mice more than likely go to aviaries and poultry farms to collect scraps of food.virus bearing and virus-secreting mice , cereals , chicken feed , poultry infection , vertical transmission of retroviruses via eggs and processing of raw protein in bavarian cream and other confectionery products occur , man being the terminus . by consumption of undercooked egg- proteins , there is an increase of ovarian cancer , breast cancer and prostate cancer in humans.humans are commonly exposed to potentially oncogenic viruses that naturally infect and are frequently endemic in animals , which are part of the food chain , such as laying hens , chickens and eggs.this is ridiculous ! eggs have been eaten in the human diet since agriculture was developed , and probably before . there is nothing wrong with eating eggs . salmonella in eggs is from unhealthy living conditions , just avoid commercially grown and eat organic pasture raised . the world today is obsessed with â what â s healthy â that i believe they lost sight of what â s natural for our species and how we â ve developed into the master race over the last few million years , it wasn â t by watching cholesterol , counting calories and eating gmo / processed foods . â i don â t eat eggs because i had a stomach injury and can no longer digest them , but i do feed them to my family.thanks lena . you are certainly welcome to make any dietary choices as you see fit . dr. greger is simply reporting on the egg industry . he is not saying we should or should not eat eggs . you make great points and i appreciate your comments ! sincerely , josephlena : re : â â¦ what â s natural for our species â¦ â i agree with you on that point . but the devil â s in the details . how do you determine what is natural ? i can think of two good ways : 1 ) by looking at our biology , 2 ) by looking at which foods promote health and which foods promote disease.the problem with using history as your guide is that humans are not natural creatures in that we do lots of things , including eating , based on custom and availability , not biology . then add in that we have so many years worth of history over such a wide variety of geographies and thus availability of food , that you have to be very careful about what lessons you take from looking as specific populations that lived a long time ago . it â s not that you can â t learn any lessons . but it does mean that you can â t conclude much with the simple idea that humans have been eating eggs for a long time . so ? humans in some populations have been dieing of heart disease and cancer for a long time too ( while other populations avoid these diseases by eating extremely small amounts of eggs and other animal products ) . what humans have been doing for a time in and of itself is not a selling point.we do have answers to the two good ways of determining what is â natural for our species â . for a great primer on what our biology tells us concerning humans eating meat , check out : humans are naturally plant eaters http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / natural.htmland for what science tells us about which foods promote health vs promote disease , you are in the right place . keep watching videos and reading the articles . the more you take in , the more you will understand this point . good luck.for people asking about egg whites , here is a repost from me , where i quote other people : there are two problems with eggs , the yolk and the white . ( to paraphrase dr. barnard . ) according to wikipedia , here â s what â s in egg beaters : â â egg beaters is primarily egg whites with added flavorings , vitamins , and thickeners xanthan gum and guar gum . it contains no egg yolks . â since egg beaters do not have egg yolks , the cholesterol issue is not in play . but egg whites are just as bad for you . dr. barnard talks about the problems that animal protein presents for kidney health . other experts talk about the ( strong in my opinion ) link between animal protein and cancer . the question scientists then want to answer is : is there a causal link ? if so , what is the mechanism by which animal protein might cause cancer ? if memory serves , dr campbell in the china study mentions several ways in which we think that animal protein causes and promotes cancer . here on nutritionfacts , you can get a great education on how animal protein is linked to the body â s over-production of a growth hormone called igf-1 . igf-1 helps cancer to grow . to watch the series about igf-1 , click on the link below and then keep clicking the â next video â link on the button to the right until you get through the bodybuilding video . then you will have seen the entire series. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop / and darryl recently reminded me about the methionine issue . egg whites have * the * highest concentration of methionine of any food : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / foods-000084000000000000000.html ? categories = 1,18,9,0,13,14,5,4,42,16,17,15,6,3,2,11,7,19,21,12,10,8,22 dr. greger did a nice video showing the link between methionine and cancer . so , there are two clear pathways linking animal proteins , especially egg whites , to cancer. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction / darryl also pointed out that , â â¦ high methionine diets increase coronary risk in humans . in its associations with cardiovascular disease and other disorders , homocysteine may be functioning partly as a marker for the major culprit , excess methionine . â http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0939475305001092and while i can â t find it right now , i believe that toxins has pointed out two other health issues with egg whites.dr. greger recently posted some videos on how animal protein can raise insulin levels . i â m not sure if that applies to egg whites or not . but here is one of the videos . i can â t find the other one. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china / with all of the information we have about the harmful effects of animal protein in general and egg white in particular , i think it â s best to stay away from egg white . why not get your protein from safe sources ? sources which are known to have lots of positive health effects and will naturally give you a balanced amount of protein ? ( ie : whole plant foods ) make sense ? is there any method of protecting the remaining pancreas in newly diagnosed diabetics ( nutritionally or lifestyle ) ? duwayne : i don â t know specifically about â protecting the remaining pancreas â . what i can say is that dr. barnard has had great success in reversing type 2 diabetes with a whole plant food based diet . ( i presume the success he has seen involved protecting the pancreas , but i â m not 100 % sure what you mean by that nor could i probably answer if i was . ) dr. barnard wrote a book , complete with recipes , on this very topic if you are interested in learning more : http : / / www.amazon.com / neal-barnards-program-reversing-diabetes / dp / 1594868107 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 _ twi _ 1 _ pap ?

does the vitamin c in hibiccus halps for the absorption of the green tea nutriants ? is it the new best beverge ? : ) thanks .. ! ! ! hmmm â¦ just how big is the egg industry ? could their influence , ahem , have possibly swayed the recent â cholesterol decision â that will surely be another green light to gobble down still more tortured animals and their byproducts ? i agree strongly with your comment . there is a book on how to control cholesterol without diet . â cholesterol control without diet . the niacin solution â by w. b. parsons . for more than 50 years , controlling cholesterol has been easy , with the use of mega doses of niacin ( 2-3 grams a day ) . this has also been lampooned by big business and big pharmacy , as being unpractical . perhaps that is what the committee is trying to report . that high triglycerides , high ldl , low hdl , are all about a niacin deficiency . niacin therapy is no longer considered safe perhaps because of the flush and the risk of nausea if taking niacin without food . also , most people will have to step their way up to these doses , this is not considered practical by modern medicine . however , a vegan diet may not be as effective as the mega doses of niacin , or maybe as effective . it seems that big business wants to have it all the way around . surely the dairy industry , egg industry , and meat industry are horrified by the benefits of less meat consumption . surely they would encourage people to use niacin therapy to aid their blood test results . did you know that nearly 2 / 3 of americans have a milk intolerance ? i was surprised to find myself among them ( i found i am a candidate for lactaid treatment , though ) , and i feel better when i eat less meat i am sure vegetarians at this site would love to present an alternative , which is also sunk by the modern money making machine , niacin therapy can extend life of those with unhealthy diets and taking chromium picolinate may blunt any igf-1 spike from eating animal protein.i am another one who cannot stomach milk , and have disliked it since i was a small child . my mom and i did daily battles over it because in the late 50 â s you did not question authority , and mom ruled ! lol ! i used to give away my school milk to a friend who promised he wouldn â t tell ! i know this is disgusting , but for me it was like swallowing mucus ! as i got older , i found i was lactose intolerant , no surprise there , and no tears either ! i never liked meat either so being vegan works for me in a myriad of ways ! i am healthier now than i was 20 years ago , and certainly lighter ! even being vegan , my cholesterol tends to be on the high side , so i do take niacin , i just have to watch the dosage because of the flushing ! thanks ! dr , abram hoffer found that niacin can cure a myriad of mental disorders , including schizophrenia , some depression , anxiety , most kinds of addiction , and bipolar disorder in the early 1950s and six years later he found that this miracle drug is good for blood chemistry as well . men and women who have done niacin therapy for heart disease probably have very good emotions . prescription niacin has been proscribed to many people without any concerns for over 70 years . the american psychological association tried to discredit him and his journal in the 1970s , a decision that still stands to this day and to wikipedia . he has treated thousands of patients successfully with the premise that they have a deficiency . the apa said that if patients respond to one gram of niacin , possibly even for addiction , they had pellagra and were downgraded as being never mentally ill . perhaps this is true . perhaps one fourth of americans have chronic pellagra and not mental illness and one third get this in each year . niacin is stripped from our whole grains in refineries and we are supposed to eat 6-11 servings of this a day . perhaps this was good too , we have more protein from milk , which has been good for mankind for the past 100 years . speaking as a botanist , fertilizer for plants ( is fertilizer cheating ? ) is just mineral nutrition , elements . what if there was fertilizer for people ? according to abram hoffer , there is , and he worked to established what would fertilize people for different diseases . this is called orthomolecular medicine . it is as alternative as nutrition therapy like that found at this site , but as profoundly beneficial . main stream medicine , like that for cancer , involves using steroids , which are a kind of fertilizer , and radiation therapy , which in a way is a kind of addition that nutrition therapy harnesses , there are poisons in plants to foreign bodies called phytonutrients . congratulations on your many years as a vegan . would you be surprised to learn that americans are deficient in many elements on average ? i think it is possible to say of the 20-60 nutrients that are essential , that is , must be eaten , cannot be made by the body like niacin and vitamin c , americans are deficient in most of them and these deficiencies are building in the form of chronic illness .. the eggstraordinary lengths the egg industry resorts to polish the image of their beloved product of chicken menstruation borders on chickanery.food is hazardous too health ! do not eat ! ! manage your risk , and eat the less hazardous foods.i am a first grade teacher and everyday my students , all public school students , are exposed to every food group that you fight so hard to expose and discourage . i see the results of â food poisoning â every week . students have all the symptoms of consuming unhealthy meals and results are found in poor academic performance . the problem seem so massive , what can be done to help change food laws in one of americas largest institutions ? the way our industrial farms raise our food is nothing less than a crime . if you refuse to buy eggs from these and only buy from local farmers or those who are cage free , there will be more humanely grown food and more nutritious and safer food . eggs contain 6-7 grams of high quality protein each , one of the best food sources on the planet . if chickens were allowed to eat their natural diet , eggs would be high in omega 3 fats . cholesterol is needed by every cell in your body , especially the brain . the brain makes it own cholesterol , but statins stop this production , and cholesterol is such a large moleule that it can not cross the blood brain barier . what happens ? memory loss , dementia , etc . elderly with the highest cholesterols live the longest â¦ .check out anthony colpo â s book , the great cholesterol con , and read the research findings on cholesterol and heart disease . why is it france enjoys such a low incidence of heart disease and has one of the highest intakes of cholesterol and saturated fat ? find out about ancel key â s , the great lier ! how our government adopted standards based on assumption and then tried to prove their hypothesis . 50 years of lies and billions of $ for the pharmaceutical industry . and worst of all focusing on a lie and ignoring what really does make a difference . a high carbohydrate diet is a killer ! ! stop eating sugar , and that low fat / high carbohydrate diet .. it â s not working ! ! stop smoking , exercise daily , decreasing stress , correct your omega 3 / 6 ratio ! , eat more omega-3 fats ( saturated fat intake helps improve omega3 status and immune function , pufas suppress your immune system ) . get adequate magnesium , coenzymeq10 , selenium , l-carnitine and nitric oxide , vitamin and minerals in the right amounts , garlic and a diet full of vegetables and fruits to provide the powerful phytonutrients our bodies need to stay healthy . the lie is being revealed , find out more : http : / / www.cnn.com / 2015 / 02 / 19 / health / dietary-guidelines / anthony colpo ? lol ! on his blog and videos plantpositive has slain colpo â s bogus research and â theories â and totally laid to rest any doubts about why keys opted to eliminate certain radically changed populations from his studies ! don â t believe what you want to read or hear , do the science ! please , especially here ! other than that , a lot of what you say has validity , but some of it is just misinformation that the paleo crowd loves to re-chant , ad nauseum ! plants heal , animals are foreign proteins and harm us in many ways . any benefits they confer can more easily be gotten from not killing a living being . a balance will help , but why not just go all plants ? it is totally doable , stop kidding yourselves and spreading silly disinfo ! the 77 pages of scientific references in the great cholesterol con are quite credible . colpo is not alone in his findings . i appreciate the reference to the plantpositive website . i will check it out . thanks ! i have yet to read anything good about ancel keys so it should be interesting . eating animal flesh is not my thing either . i do free range eggs every once in a while â¦ â¦ .. and then non-gmo organic plants . but the idea that cholesterol causes heart disease is like blaming the paramedic for the accident . my point isn â t to eat paleo , my point is we need to be looking elsewhere and quit wasting our money and lives on a lie . stress , sugar & obesity , pufa , smoking , inactivity , environmental toxins , etc these are the killers.your body would probably love to turn all the cholesterol it makes into vitamin d3 . too little time too little sunshine . the meatless diet can add more than 10 years to your life.i am in total agreement with you on the â killers â and i personally think the cholesterol issue is a smokescreen for eating animal products in general . good , bad or indifferent , it only comes from animals , besides what we ourselves produce , the issue isn â t just cholesterol . glad to hear you are primarily plant based too ! the garbage they call our â food â supply is getting more frightening , it isn â t even food anymore , and it â s devastating when you see so many sick kids . we never heard of asthma , allergies , autism , and the list goes on , when i was a kid in school in the 60 â s , but now the school nurses can â t keep up with doing out all the medications in my grandkids school ! it really scares the bleep out of me ! i think this person represents what most americans eat and do . i like this site because it gives me hope that i am not going to get many chronic diseases and have lots of options in health . you will not find many friends here for your ideas that a plant based high carb diet is bad . this is not a pro paleo or adkins site . dr. greger is hoping to instill healthier living in all americans . i would say that rich people live longer and western americans have less disease than the third world . i would also say our diet is a factor . i would say for the first time our children are not going to live as long as us , and this is when smoking is declining . why are the wealthier healthier than the poor when the poor eat so much less meat ? well , if you lived in the depression according to one poster , your increased consumption of beans would mean you would live five years longer than any other time . statistically , i would rather be rich than poor for my health . however , the rich are not the blessed of modern religion . why are the poor not healthier if they are more blessed ? why do those who go to harvard live longer than any other cohort group in the country ? this disjunct keeps priests awake . if you work in the egg industry , eggs are probably a big factor in what nourishes america . i would say the fda might say that it is okay to call an egg nourishing . i would also say that they are not something that is going to keep you alive into your 100s . is this your goal ? eggs have fed americans . are they part of a complete diet ? maybe not according to the food groups the vegans of this site are drawing . it is possible that cholesterol is made by the liver to fed something in the body that is not well fed by cholesterol as vegans , who do not eat cholesterol , still have cholesterol in their bodies . in this way , cholesterol is not an essential element , but it is a nutrient on food labels . vegans do not have any cholesterol at all in their diet . .so what they do is focus on protein in eggs . but a recent study that i don â t think the egg industry had any part in hinted that eggs might help prevent type 2 diabetes .

            "Query PLAIN-43: organic milk and prostate cancer researchers have expressed concern that since cow â s milk contains estrogens , dairy could stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors . the thought is that the consumption of dairy products could both â promote the conversion of precancerous lesions or mutated cells to invasive cancer and enhance the progression of hormone-dependent tumors . â this was initially postulated based on suggestive population-scale data like a 25 fold increase in prostate cancer in japan since world war ii . what was happening to their diets during that period ? a 5 , 10 , and 20 fold increase in eggs , meat , and dairy consumption , respectively , whereas the rest of their diet remained pretty stable . but diet wasn â t the only major change in japanese lifestyles over the latter half century . similarly , even though countries with higher milk consumption tend to have more prostate cancer deaths and countries with lower milk consumption fewer deaths , there could be hundreds of confounding variables . but it certainly does spur interest in studying the possibility . a recent study from clemson university represents the other extreme , controlling for as many factors as possible by isolating prostate cancer cells out of the body in a petri dish and dripping cow milk on them directly . the researchers chose organic cow â s milk , because they wanted to exclude the effect of added hormones so that they could test the effect of all the growth hormones and sex steroids found naturally in milk . they found that cow â s milk stimulated the growth of human prostate cancer cells in each of 14 separate experiments , producing an average increase in cancer growth rate of over 30 % . in contrast , almond milk suppressed the growth of these cancer cells by over 30 % . but just because something happens in a petri dish or a test tube doesn â t mean the same thing happens in a person . it â s just suggestive evidence that we can use in a grant application to get money to study actual people . this can be done with a retrospective ( looking backward ) study where we take prostate cancer patients and figure out what they ate in the past , or a prospective ( looking forward ) study where we look at people â s diets first and follow them for a few years and see who gets cancer . the looking back kind are typically referred to as case-control studies , because researchers look at cases of cancer and compare their diets to controls . the looking forward kind are often called cohort studies because a cohort of people is followed forward . then , if we want to get fancy , we can do a so-called meta-analysis , where you combine all the best studies done to date and see what the balance of available evidence shows . the latest meta-analysis of all the best case control studies ever done on the matter concludes that milk consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer . and the latest meta-analysis of all the best cohort studies ever done also concludes that milk consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer . an even newer study profiled in my video , prostate cancer and organic milk vs. almond milk , suggests that milk intake during adolescence may be particularly risky in terms of potentially setting one up for cancer later in life . despite hormone-related cancers being among our top killers , as pointed out in the journal of the national cancer institute , â we simply do not know which hormones , and how much , are in the food that we ingest . more effort has been directed at the investigation of illicit use of designer steroids by olympians and ballplayers than to the investigation of the effect of dietary hormones on cancer and other diseases that affect millions . â a proposal is therefore made to monitor levels of steroid and other hormones and growth factors in all dairy and meat-containing foods , though to date this has not been done . i touched previously on the prostate cancer data in one of my oldest videos , slowing the growth of cancer . other factors may play into the link between cancer and dairy consumption including industrial pollutants ( industrial carcinogens in animal fat ) and igf-1 ( how plant-based to lower igf-1 ? ) , but for more on the hormones in dairy see : what about all the studies suggesting milk â does a body good â ? see my video food industry â funding effect â . i can â t play the video â¦ .this is a blog entry only , without a video . however the names of related previously published videos are mentioned within the text and you can view these by clicking on them.there is no video it is an article.article titled â organic milk and prostate cancer â , yet no mention of organic milk . almond milk only alternative mentioned â¦ it â s in the fourth paragraph , second sentence â the researchers chose organic cow â s milk â¦ â the reference is here : â the researchers chose organic cow â s milk , because they wanted to exclude the effect of added hormones so that they could test the effect of all the growth hormones and sex steroids found naturally in milk . â in the 4th paragraph , organic milk also contains naturally occurring estrogen , the amount is dependent upon the gestation period in which the cow is milked. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / ? term = naturally + occurring + estrogen + in + raw + milkwhat role might the phytoestrogens in soy and other plant based foods have in tumor growth ? in epidemiological studies , soy consumption is shown to both prevent cancer as well as increase survival rates in those already diagnosed . in vitro studies using isolated soy phytoestrogens show favorable epigenetic effects and enzymatic inhibition . by overwhelming scientific consensus , it can be stated that the soy phytoestrogens , as well as those found in other foods such as flaxseeds and other beans , are protective against cancer.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / brca-breast-cancer-genes-and-soy / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / breast-cancer-survival-and-soy / http : / / link.springer.com / article / 10.1007 / s11064-010-0142-2 # page-1they play no role at all , they are not actual estrogens . that dairy industry talking point has been debunked . see here : https : / / vimeo.com / 111054783 and here : https : / / vimeo.com / 109373842um â¦ doesn â t look like you read the article very carefully . definitely does mention organic milk.i â m wondering if the nuclear bomb hitting japan might have beenlinked to cancer increasesi lost what i â ve just typed i think , the information on the correlation between the atomic bomb , fukushima etc can be found at : http : / / www.rerf.or.jp / index _ e.html with a lot of conjoint research between the u.s and japan . you can select english or japanese version of the site at the top right hand corner of the website . another site from japan confirms dr g â s report about dairy , meat , fat may be linked with prostate cancer . they also mentioned calcium , i am not a dr so unsure of which type . they also mentioned an animal protein called igf-1 , which is linked with prostate cancer.has there been any studies using raw milk vs almond milk ? i â ve read ( e.g. in an article by dr. mirkin â well known sports medicine doctor ) that for some reason , there â s no evidence yogurt has the same effect . i â d appreciate hearing from anyone with information on this.did dr. mirkin provide any sources for that claim ? from what i understand , the main problem with dairy is its signalling proteins â specifically , leucine , which stimulates igf-1 and mtor growth signalling. https : / / eatandbeatcancer.wordpress.com / 2014 / 07 / 23 / anti-cancer-diets-whats-the-deal-with-dairy / yes , dr. mirkin always provides references . i located his blog post and got the reference. http : / / drmirkin.com / men / is-lifestyle-responsible-for-our-epidemic-of-prostate-cancer.htmlhttp : / / www.jurology.com / article / s0022-5347 ( 14 ) 02524-5 / pdf pd31-06 dairy intake and prostate cancer risk : results from the california collaborative prostate cancer studygood question ! one of my projects as graduate student in nutrition was a review of the literature on dairy foods and prostate cancer risk , so to my knowledge there is some evidence for yogurt but not as much as there is on dairy foods as a group or milk in particular . many of the studies that look at dairy consumption combine yogurt with other dairy foods and do not analyze it separately . other studies do look at yogurt separately but have a very narrow range of intake in their study , making it difficult to draw conclusions about risk . to illustrate , i have linked a couple of the larger studies below.the multiethnic cohort study did not show an association between yogurt consumption and prostate cancer risk , but the highest grouping of intake was > 40 grams per day ( less than 1 / 4 cup ) .in contrast , the epic study did show a significant increase in risk with higher consumption of yogurt ( 17 % increased risk for the highest intake group with a median of 57 grams per day ) .if you are interested , the review i did was published in oncology nutrition connection and you can access it here . the section i originally wrote on yogurt was not included , however , as they were looking for a shorter article and the evidence for yogurt was simply not as robust as other dairy foods.raslam : this post is really helpful because a lot of people have posted questions on nutritionfacts about dairy yogurt in particular as opposed to dairy in general . that â s cool that you have looked into the issue so deeply ( or as deep as exists right now ) . thanks for sharing.thanks very much ! your comments and links are very helpful.hi david ! it may be helpful to think of all the health problems created by dairy use rather than specific dairy foods being higher in this or that cancer . the milk protein itself , casein , accounts for 87 % of milk is naturally carcinogenic.in addition to prostate cancer , dairy causes cardiovascular disease [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public / ] , [ [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease / ] , autoimmune issues , allergy issues , crib death and autism [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / cows-milk-casomorphin-and-autism / ] , hormone issues [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / estrogen-in-meat-dairy-and-eggs / ] , saturated fat , trans-fat [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy / ] , cholesterol , hormones [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / dairy-hormonal-interference / ] , and puss.thanks for the feedback . i agree with you , and am very concerned about prostate cancer . but diary is known to reduce gout flare ups and so for a vegan like me who has had them , it seems natural to think about eating some dairy . i was surprised to read one study that found vegans have higher uric acid levels than meat or fish eaters , and vegetarians the lowest of all dietary types ( perhaps because of dairy ) . perhaps that was so because many of the vegans in the study were eating refined carbs , but i don â t think this was investigated . anyway , that â s what sparked my interest in low / no fat yogurt as perhaps the least harmful dairy product overall with one positive benefit for those with gout.i thought uric acid came from the break-down of proteins â¦ ( not carbs ) ? here â s a link to a good description : http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = george & dbid = 51uric acid comes from the breakdown of purines , not protein . purines are in dna / rna and are the result of the body breaking down cells . but there is a connection to protein â foods high in protein tend to be high in purines . i don â t understand why plant purines are less likel to cause gout flare ups but that â s what choi found : choi , h. k. , k. atkinson , e. w. karlson , w. willett , and g. curhan . â purine-rich foods , dairy and protein intake , and the risk of gout in men . â n engl j med . 2004 350 ( 11 ) : 1093-103.choi , h. k. , s. liu , and g. curhan . â intake of purine-rich foods , protein , and dairy products and relationship to serum levels of uric acid : the third national health and nutrition examination survey . â arthritis rheum .

( rr per 200 g / day . 98 ) has anyone on staff looked at this meta-analysis ? if so , could you provide some insight ? i have been reviewing this meta-analysis in more depth â and want to point out that while the study concluded that whole milk may be somewhat protective , it identified two fairly recent studies showing an association between prostate cancer and risk of progression to fatal disease . see http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3542910 / thanks for these pointers . i don â t have access to the 32 cohorts study but will read the other one.i am horrified that i encouraged my three children ( 2 boys an 1 girl ) to drink milk when they were growing up ( as is the praxis in dairy-traditional sweden where i live ) thinking i was doing the right thing . all that dairy at home and school , thinking it was a good source of calcium , yet this country has the highest rate of osteoporosis in the world.have always bought organic food , even though it is very expensive here and i have very small means . think food is more important than clothes or anything else you spend money on , as it is an investment in your health . recently been learning about plant-based diets through my daughter ( 19 ) who is vegan and through this site . i make only vegan food when she visits and i like it too . i drink organic soy milk myself now instead of cows milk.in general i â ve always eaten very little meat ( and nearly always organic ) . always said i could easily be a vegetarian since i like all of those vegetarian foods . ( or at least a pescetarian ) ; i grew up right on a little fishing lake in michigan and like eating fish and love seafood . haven â t eaten meat in a long time now , but have eaten fish with my boys . i â m scared to death of chicken since i â ve learned more about it . have been avoiding cheese for a while , but find it â s really tempting , my oldest son ( 21 , lives on his own ) was influenced to purchase more fruit and vegetables by my daughter . he hasn â t changed the rest of his diet however . he is very physically active and trim but smokes unfortunately ( that cough of his really scares me ) . though cigarettes aren â t as bad as all the things he used to put in his body and brain , if you get my drift ( he â s been clean for over a year ) , so i can â t push too hard.the youngest is 15 ( who lives mostly with his father ) has some problems with weight gain due to medications and an extremely sedentary lifestyle because of agoraphobia and extrem social anxiety . been trying to get his father to at least use lower fat dairy products ( which my son eats no problem when he â s with me ) but my ex-husband doesn â t listen well to others , especially me , and he is not easily convinced of anything . my ex â s father has prostate cancer and his maternal grandfather died from it , so if there are any hereditary factors my boys might not be so lucky.i just hope the example my daughter is setting and my own attempts to change my eating habits will influence them in a positive direction . my ex has hypertension so i sent him an article about flax seeds and he seemed very interested , so there is some hopd.stacey , i think a lot of us understand both your frustration with the misdirection of health based education over the decades and also the current issues surrounding what you now know in relation to reluctant loved ones ! at least i do ! though nutrition will probably always be open to it â s areas of debate , so many of the facts get twisted by those with an agenda , and it just makes doing the right thing almost impossible for most people . i decided the best course ultimately , was to simplify to the extreme . it works on all levels for me because it is the cheapest route too ! no animals products , and nothing processed â¦ plant products as they come from nature , or mildly processed , as in cooking , fermenting , or simple ways of preserving . if i make bread i even grind my own grain , often sprouted first . a bit more work but also so satisfying on a gut level ! ( ha ha , i made a punny ! ) keep taking the best care that you can of yourself â¦ and whoever else you can , and hope that they get the message . i know this is no help , but you aren â t alone in it ! thanks for your encouragement ! i suggest try to find a local farmers market in your area. http : / / www.localharvest.org / just punch in the zip code and a list will show up , not only of farmers markets , but farms , meat suppliers etc . ( i am not sure if you live in u.s. or not â this site may be limited to u.s. ) sometimes , produce from farmers markets are more reasonably priced . i live on a very limited income , so i understand your frustration and i â ve noticed prices are sky-rocketing where i live . not a good sign . : ( i also suggest look to acquire some heirloom seeds . even if you don â t have land or a yard , produce can be grown in containers and also see if there is a community farm or co-ops in your area . these are merely suggestions , in the end you will make the decisions that work best for you and your family . : - ) yes , in time by taking steps yourself in your choices , will play an impact on other people in your life.thanks for your suggestions . i live in sweden . food prices are among the highest in europe . we have a value added tax ( a type of sales tax , included in the sticker price ) of 12 % on food and 25 % on everything else . also there is a near monopoly with the few grocery store chains . unfortunately many swedes have the attitude that you should spend the least amount of your money on food , perhaps because it â s so unreasonably expensive . of course , organic food is even more expensive . i recently bought organic cauliflower for about $ 5 a pound.there is at least another meta-analysis supporting the same conclusions ( just thought it would be interesting pointing out as it is more recent ) : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25527754 . it looks at dairy products in general but seems to look each product individually ( milk vs cheese , etc ) .hi , i would like a video about food for childeren ( 8-10 years old ) ; should they eat meat , dairy , raw milk etc to grow ? or what should they eat / supplement to max. there health . thanks.the only way for an optimum healthy life is to consume raw organic foods . all your veggies should be certified organic , your meat should be pastured grass fed , milk should be raw , nuts and seeds should be raw and uncooked . this is how humans lived for thousands of years and how mother nature intended it to be.you post very cogent , well researched statements â kudos . question : with something being certified â organic â â is that a reasonable assurance , considering organic standards are not enforced ? i try to buy local when i can . i knew some local farmers that were selling their produce / meats / products at a local farmer â s market â¦ the fda threatened to shut down their stands , since they used the term organic . the farmers were very ethical and proud of their organic products . it â s almost as if the fda owns the rights to the term organic . i suggested , to just label their products are pesticide free , hormone free , etc. instead . ; - ) when i first learned of the industrialized food system ( codex , fda laughable standards , meat industry , gmo contamination of farmland , acquisition of seed companies from monsanto and the like , etc ) it was disturbing . : o luckily , farmers are banding together , and defending food freedoms and independence . buy clean ( heirloom seeds ! i can â t stress that enough , for anyone that reads this â¦ . ) .usda is the agency in control of organic certification ; fda considers ( at best ) proportions of organic ingredients in a processed , labeled product . the natl organic standards board decides details . whoever hassled the farmers , they were selling their crop as organic without being certified ; since the 1990s , that â s a federal no-no , and so far has stopped a lot of fraud and frustrated some presumably honest but often not-well-informed farmers . if you have faith in a local farmer â s honesty and knowledge , lack of certification is no obstacle . they just can â t use the word . some go biodynamic and are certified by demeter , whose rules differ a bit.ilse : dr. greger has several videos which discuss health issues regarding children . it is very important to note that none of videos support children eating any meat , dairy or eggs . there â s even one video where dr. greger quotes the famous pediatrician , dr. spock ( sp ? ) as saying that no dairy is appropriate for children after they are weaned.it is the position of the american dietetic association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets , including total vegetarian or vegan diets , are healthful , nutritionally adequate , and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases . well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle , including pregnancy , lactation , infancy , childhood , and adolescence , and for athletes . here are dr. greger â s general nutrition recommendations : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / but you have a fair point that children do have some special needs , and those are not specifically addressed by dr. greger â s materials . i think that the site vrg ( vegetarian resource group ) has some great , well-researched materials regarding how to feed children healthy food . check out these pages : http : / / www.vrg.org / nutshell / kids.php http : / / www.vrg.org / family / kidsindex.htmyou might also check out materials from the physician â s committee for responsible medicine ( pcrm ) , which is another wonderfully well-research source for information on healthy eating : http : / / www.pcrm.org / pdfs / health / info _ children.pdf http : / / www.pcrm.org / pdfs / health / info _ advchild.pdfhope that helps ! isn â t cow â s milk one of the harder milks for the majority of the population to digest ? also , since organic standards are not really enforced , could some of these issues be attributed to milk that is labelled organic , but in reality not ? organic gives the food companies a reason to jack up the price â¦ .but it doesn â t mean they are truly organic . fda standards are abysmal.again , the rules are enforced â by nosb , founded by organic farmers as part of usda . for a good critique of organics in the us , see cornucopia â s ranking of nominally organic milks and eggs , and last november yogurts.i â d be curious to break it down even more : was the milk they used pasteurized / homogenized . what about raw milk ? our family gets raw cow â s milk and i am no longer drinking it because i believe it might be causing inflammation and my dh is also doing an experiment and quitting it for awhile , however , my kids still drink some , but i have cut way back for them.organic milk and raw milk are very different . organic milk , while labeled organic , can still contain pesticides and it is pasteurized ( heated to the point where vitamins and nutrition is destroyed ) and homogenized ( fat globules broken up ) . raw milk is not pasteurized or homogenized . raw milk retains all the natural fat and nutrition which actually help regulate the body and to lose weight . yes , natural fat can help lose weight . they might as well used factory farm milk in this study . such a shame to see deceiving studies taking place , misinforming the public . make sure to drink raw milk , not organic , because big corporations have tainted the â organic â name.all milk is formulated to stimulate growth , especially i would think raw milk . it is not just the hormones that are directly absorbed and remain active in the human body , but also the proteins themselves . animal studies with isolated casein protein , the primary protein in milk stimulated and promoted cancer growth to such a degree that 100 % of the rats who consumed it developed liver cancer . in contrast none of rats feed plant protein , either wheat gluten or soy protein , developed liver cancer . 100 : 0 ratio ! in humans cows milk has been shown to stimulate the production of igf-1 , which plays a central role in the progression of many types of cancer.the reason for this different reaction between plant and animal protein is the ratio of amino acids in the different proteins . animal foods have more sulfur containing amino acids than plant protein , especially milk protein . so it is the very protein in milk that signals the infant mammal to grow , grow , grow ! and the growth signal is controlled by the percentage of calories represented by protein . slow growing animals like humans have milk with only about 5 % of calories as protein while very fast growing like rats have milk with 50 % of calories from protein . cow milk runs about 20 % -23 % protein , and so provides a much stronger growth signaling than human milk . not surprising really since a 60 lb calf needs to get to be a 600 lb cow in less than a year.and all of this is only important to infants . adult of all mammal species including humans have no need for such growth signaling . when it is still given in adulthood it will still stimulate growth , but often not of the type desired . at the cosmetic level it stimulated the skin and can be the source of acne . at a more important level it stimulates the growth of cancer.mammalian milk raw or pasteurized , organic or not , is definitely a functional food we all need to stay away from as adults.well â¦ . if you pour whiskey on prostate cancer cells in a culture , they will probably die . that does , unfortunately , not mean that drinking whiskey will kill a prostate cancer in a human body . estrogen in milk will probably not make it through the liver ( that â s why contraceptive hormones have to be modified to work when taken orally ) . more interesting in this context may be the increased exposure to dioxins and similar highly stable compounds of which some can mimick the effects of sex hormones . prostate cancer grows best when nurtured by testosterone , while estrogen may have the opposite effect.any sense of who funded the clemson university study ? [ in future , would it not seem relevant to include who the funder ( s ) were of each study ? ) i am not sure . you can find the study here , but in the actual blog dr. greger always gives us the links.i posted my question because neither the video nor what i can see at the study link provides information about funders of the clemson university study . so , i â m sorry to say , a response 3 months later which reads â i am not sure â is not helpful.gotcha ! well thanks for telling me . forgive the delay it â s just that we receive perhaps 300 + emails a day ! here is the answer to your question : â funding for this study was provided by the cancer research fund donated to clemson university by mr. and mrs. james creel and by the healthcare genetics program , department of nursing , clemson university â many , many , many sincere thanks ! it bolsters the study to know the funders are not the type likely to expect skew results.i would love to know if there has been any work done on other dairy sources ( eg butter , and cheese ) , or is it all milk-focused ? hi nnmlly . these links will send you to everything we have on butter and cheese . all dairy products have lactose , which contain galactose ( the sugar found in milk that may be harmful ) . yogurt may have a bit less galactose , but it is still there . milk seems to be the most destructive of the dairy foods , but yogurt and other dairy products like cheese ( although the research is mixed ) , have been associated with increased risk of insulin-like growth factor , which can boost other disease risks like cancer . another study shows higher intake of lactose ( equivalent of 3 glasses of milk per day ) may be associated with ovarian cancer risk . so yes , lots on milk , but still plenty of studies that lump dairy protein together showing a connection between lots of dairy products and cancer risk . for example , this study found high intake of dairy protein and calcium from dairy products and high serum concentration of igf-i were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer . perhaps it â s the amount that matters ? of course these are only observational studies , but they can help identify trends . hope that helps answer your question . take a look though some of this and let me know if you further questions.thanks for posting this , josephthank you so much for this reply.i live in a very dairy-focused country ( new zealand ) , but do not buy milk for my family on the basis of the available research ( i can â t quite kick my occasional haloumi habit though ) .my child is completely dairy-free due to an intolerance . people often lecture me about giving her a calcium deficiency â the diary campaign here is so strong , that many people think she should spend her childhood in hospital , unable to breathe , rather then forgo milk.i spent some time looking at the literature around calcium requirements and was rather shocked to discover that recommended intakes overlapped with levels known to cause heart problems in some demographics . my conclusion was that recommended intakes were likely higher than needed , and that a clean wholefood diet , heavy on vegetables and devoid of processed crap ( along with plenty of outdoors activity ) ought to suffice.regardless â this is a happier , healthier home for being milk-free . thank you for sharing your research.annaplant-based milks should be fortified with calcium . don â t forget the beans and greens ! huge amounts there , as well as sesame seeds , nuts , seeds , even dried fruits like figs , but yes make sure to get enough calcium for the kiddo ! sounds like you â re on the right track : ) yup â beans , greens , sesame seeds , nuts , seeds , figs all take a front row in her diet . it took a few years to get her to eat all these things voluntarily , but the perseverance was worth it â she happily munches through them as meals or snacks.she is four now , and she just made ( with a wee bit of chopping help ) the salad to go with our dinner , and it has all the above in it ! thanks for the reassurance ! i drink milk almond milk , cancer , dairy , eggs , estrogen , factory farming practices , farm animals , growth promoters , hormones , japan , meat , men 's health , metastases , milk , mortality , organic foods , organic milk , prostate cancer , prostate health , steroids - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-55: foods for macular degeneration anyone who has gotten a bad sunburn knows how damaging the uv rays in sunlight can be . imagine what those same rays are doing to back of our eyeballs ( our retinas ) . the eye is designed to take sunlight and focus it like a magnifying glass into the back of our eyes . thankfully , we have a layer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium that supports and protects our delicate retinal eyesight machinery . the layer builds up yellow plant pigments like zeaxanthin from our diet , absorbing blue light and protecting the retina from photo-oxidative damage . the yellowing of our corneas when we develop cataracts may actually be our bodies â defense mechanism to protect our retinas . in fact , when cataracts are removed , the risk of blindness from macular generation shoots up ( because we removed the protection ) . instead of trading one type of vision loss for another , it â s better to pigment the back of our eyes through diet instead of pigmenting the front of our eyes with cataracts . the pigment in the back of our eyes is entirely of dietary origin , â suggesting that the most common cause of blind registration in the western world could be delayed , or even averted , with appropriate dietary modification , â according to authors of a study on age-related macular degeneration . where in our diet do we get these pigments ? the egg industry brags that eggs are a good source , but have nearly six high-lutein , free-range , certified organic eggs a week for three months and the pigmentation in one â s eyes may only marginally increase ( see egg industry blind spot ) . instead of getting the phytonutrients from the egg that came from the chicken that came from the corn and blades of grass the chicken pecked on , we could get it from the source . one cup of corn and a half cup of spinach a day for three months seems to dramatically boost the protective eye pigment in subjects . in the video , dietary prevention of age related macular degeneration , you can see a comparison of the amount of these phytonutrients from eggs compared to corn and spinach . if we cut out the middlehen and get these nutrients from plants directly , we see a substantially larger increase in protective eye pigment . three months after the subjects stopped eating the corn and spinach , the levels of these pigments remained relatively high , indicating that once we build our macular pigment up with a healthy diet , our eyeballs really try to hold on to it . so even if we go on vacation and end up eating more iceberg lettuce than spinach , our eyes will hold out until we get back . eggs can increase zeaxanthin levels in the blood , but they can also raise bad cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease . thus , as researchers conclude , â an egg yolk-based dietary strategy to increase plasma zeaxanthin cannot be recommended , and an alternative , cholesterol-free , food source is desirable . â one such alternative would be goji berries , which have up to 60 times more zeaxanthin than eggs . a modest dose of goji markedly increases levels in our body . consumption of goji berries may be an effective , safe whole food strategy to increase zeaxanthin in the bloodstream . but we don â t need it in our blood , we need it in our eyes . a group of researchers performed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of goji berries at increasing pigment levels . to preserve eyesight in the elderly in traditional chinese medicine , people are often prescribed 40 to 100 goji berries a day . in this study , participants consumed only about 15 berries a day for three months . even at this small dose researchers found that goji berries could protect against loss of pigment and prevent the buildup of debris that builds up in the back of the eye . both loss of pigment and debris buildup are associated with age-related macular degeneration . macular degeneration is the leading cause of legal blindness in older men and women , affecting more than ten million americans , so increasing our consumption of these pigments as a society could significantly decrease the prevalence of blindness . in the above study , researchers gave the goji berries in milk so the butterfat could increase the absorption of these carotenoid pigments . a healthier way to get the same effect would just be to eat goji berries with nuts or seeds â in other words , goji trail mix . though they didn â t appear to boost a measure of immune function ( boosting natural killer cell activity ) , goji berries are one of the most antioxidant packed snacks out there . a tip on getting them inexpensively can be found in my video are goji berries good for you ? goji berries are from the nightshade family and can cause intense pain-issues and neurological ailments in certain individuals whose bodies â can not effectively deal with the alkaloids in nightshades . a nightshade-free diet eliminated most of my joint pain and arthritic and neurological issues.since you , dr. greger , found out how much much better indian gooseberries are , couldn â t one substitute org . amla powder for the goji berries ( i did use a teaspoon per person in my morning smoothie ) ? obviously i can â t speak for dr. greger , but one interpretation is that if you want good anti-oxident protection you add amla whereas if you want corneal pigments you use goji berries.i wouldn â t be surprised if half a teaspoon of each wasn â t better for you than a teaspoon of either.thank you , jeff ! i am glad you showed me the need for both for different ways to help our vision ! where do you find goji berries ? i see them covered in dark chocolate but not by themselves.perhaps this link would be of use. http : / / www.amazon.com / healthworks-certified-organic-goji-berries / dp / b00bpx4ops / ref = sr _ 1 _ 2 ? ie = utf8 & qid = 1420159200 & sr = 8-2 & keywords = goji + berries thank you.znaturalfoods.comon a goji bush â¦ do you know how to get down off an elephant ? sorry , i got tullamore dew for christmas.goji berries covered in dark chocolate are probably healthy as long as you aren â t particularly sugar sensitive and you avoid other sugar sources . they would probably be significantly less healthy for the pocketbook , though.it is the lens ( not the cornea ) that yellows from uv and develops cataracts.both lens and cornea are subject to clouding up.ha ! ! â middlehen â â¦ article is informative and funnythere seems to be an error in describing the goji berry dosing used in the cited studies . here and in videos , dr. greger says the the studies used 15 berries / day . however , as i read the studies cited the doses used were 13.7 grams / day in one and 15 grams / day in the other . i â ve counted out and weighted goji berries and found that it took roughly 80 berries to make up even 14 grams . that is nearly 2 tablespoons , and would be more in line with the traditional chinese medicine dosing ( 40-100 berries ) that dr. greger mentions.please check , clarify , and correct if needed.i have early macular degeneration and have been using goji berries at the 15 berries / day dosing since dr. greger â s videos on the subject ; but i guess i had not checked the dosing against the cited studies until today.i would be happier at the low dose , because medline says goji berries exert â moderate â interactions with medications , including suppression of the liver â s p450 cytochrome detoxification system â which might cause an unwanted increase in blood levels of one of my antiviral meds.http : / / www.nlm.nih.gov / medlineplus / druginfo / natural / 1025.htmlthere have been case reports of serious interactions with warfarin.these potential drug interactions might be worth noting.i would much prefer to be told i â m missing something , or otherwise mistaken about the study dosing.thanks to dr. greger for all your work , and a happy new year to all ! i sympathize with you because i know someone who struggles with this problem too . it takes a lot of toughness to cope with md . what if you back off the berries and compensate with some spinach ? i if you don â t like spinach ( like me ) , you might try mixing in with swiss chard , arugula and kale . for some reason i love the blended flavours of green leafies. the more the merrier ! best wishes to you . keep up the fight ! thanks . i â m lucky to like spinach , with or w / o other green leafies . actually , my habit lately has been to have spinach daily , in a mid-morning smoothie that includes goji berries . ( but how many ? ? ? ) i â m also lucky to have no symptoms so far from my macular degeneration â that â s what i meant by â early â ( at 63 it â s not early onset ) .it amazes me how spinach and asparagus can be so disgusting cooked to dark green and sloppy ( with or without mayonnaise ) and yet so delicious raw ( spinach ) or lighly sauteed ( asparagus ) topped with a little vinaigrette.arugula and kale have their own benefits . ( oops â¦ i thought md meant muscular distrophy . i was wondering if you were a mind-reader . ) i grew up with cooked spinach ( with cream ) and i like raw spinach as a smoothie with an orange or a pear . but lately i must have had too much smoothie as my breakfast because i have been told by an older sweet md ( gone to be with the lord already at age 96 ) before when the output still has almost the same color as the input then it did not get digested well enough . and he used to give me a product called zypan ( = pancreatic enzymes + â¦ ) and that helped me in the past ( to be taken with a meal that is not hotter than lukewarm ) , but i did not like that he thought i would have to keep taking this with meals ( that my digestion would not improve ) . he said that older people do not have enough stomach acid for digestion ? any thoughts on this ? and does the spinach and the corn have to be raw to be of benefit ? thank you for any and all input ! hmmm . i typed â what causes macular degeneration â and searched with duckduckgo.com ( it doesnt track you ) , and all the hits say it is caused by getting old and genetics : â although early onset cases are becoming more common in patients as young as 40 â³ . pretzel logic . round up the usual suspects . you â re all helpless victims.shouldn â t someone write the retina-international folks a letter ? with letters after their name ? thanks , coacervate , for â duckduckgo.com â ! bilberries were used in wwii for pilots to protect their eyesight . it is likely blueberries also support eye health . while the dark anthocyanins characterize dark berries , often the lighter pigments occur as well , and there are other health advantages to blues . in addition , they are not in the nightshade family . blues are widely available , sourced in the u.s.i am extraordinarily fond of this story . it is widely reported and re-reported , and is occasionally debunked as a myth . when sir winston churchill ordered an attack on a german dam , he ordered a very precise night strike that would be very hard on the eyes even during the day using bouncing bombs to avoid torpedo nets . i believe these pilots were told to improve their night vision and i believe they used carrots . it is said by some that the raf pilots were told to say that they were eating bilberry jam to confuse the german spies that were present into thinking that would cause night vision improvement . i feel this story today shows that purple pumpkins or purple carrots , possibly their original color , would actually be better for the eyesight than they are now . those are the foods that are known to improve eyesight . it is actually not really known if bilberries are good for eyesight , but they would be good for anyone who eats them ! goji berries can improve vision , reported here.wait ! you mean pumkins used to be purple ? ? ? i feel so cheated ! bilberries were used in wwii for pilots to protect their eyesight . it is likely blueberries also support eye health . while the dark anthocyanins characterize dark berries , often the lighter pigments occur as well , and there are other health advantages to blues . in addition , they are not in the nightshade family . blues are widely available , sourced in the u.s.please , can you tell me what â legal â blindness means ? brite , legal blindness is defined in america as 20 / 200 as best possible corrected vision in either eye . unaided vision is not defined in blindness . according to optometrists , 20 / 20 is average vision for america for all ages . what is the standard deviation of eyesight ? eyesight can worsen throughout life . only more than 3.6 million americans over 40 have vision less than 20 / 40 according to optometrists. http : / / www.aao.org / newsroom / upload / eye-health-statistics-april-2011.pdf i am surprised at how good american vision is , very few people have less than perfect vision according to optometrists.thanks a lot , matthew , for your veryy clear and complete answer.i think that the contradiction leans in the possibility of a correction ( it is said â even with eyeglasses ) .thank you ! perhaps eye wear is worn mostly to correct astigmatism . or , as you say , perhaps only 3.6 million americans have eyesight that cannot be corrected to 20 / 20 . please excuse the typo i corrected . â were â to â wear . â i think it is very challenging for the brain to see and hear at the same time , and uses brain waves to achieve that goal , the alpha to see , the delta to hear . even on a pot of matcha tea a day i still cannot see 20 / 20 with my alpha brain wave being very over active . did you know all optics , including the human eye , produce an image that is upside down and mirrored ? the central optic nerve in your brain has to reverse and invert this . the delta brain wave might help generate depth perception . nuts and seeds can cause the delta brain wave , and maybe so can elder flower tea . it is very challenging to produce the cones that it takes to hear in three dimensions with a flat ear , it is challenging to locate a sound . i think the delta brain wave works with the alpha brain wave to achieve this , location in hearing . this is a very difficult task that can cause pain or disease if it becomes disoriented . i have often wondered why people with brain damage still do not have problems of perception in seeing or location in hearing . perhaps these brain waves are deep inside of us . perhaps they use the whole of the nervous system . thank you for your help . â the alpha to see , the delta to hear . â i think it â s a lot more likely that delta is needed to both see and hear and alpha is needed to coordinate and report results . i would bet that delta brain waves occur during pattern recognition on non-myelinated , heavily circular neurons and alpha brain waves occur on myelinated neurons that stretch relatively straight between brain regions . i am sure a neurologist could probably come along and find a couple errors in my understanding , though . â the central optic nerve in your brain has to reverse and invert this . â i think the central optic nerve reports to the processing center in the back of the brain * as mapped * and the inversion happens somewhere after that . i am not really even sure that â upside down â is a well-defined concept . think of sensory perception as a topological phenomenon â you can stretch and turn without changing things , but â between â is meaningful ( although with a different meaning at the nerve source than at the brain center target ) and the primary conserved property is consistency of destination . the same point on your body will always send impulses to the same processing column in your brain regardless of what other factors change . distance between areas on your body ( i am talking about touch instead of vision now â hopefully the metaphor holds ) are determined experimentally by your brain based on a signal pattern running across your body in pulses whose timing trigger the mapping on the brain structures.also if you have less than 20 degrees of vision you are termed â legally blind â . so a person could see 20 / 20 but still be legally blind if their vision field is less than 20 degrees . most people have 140 degrees of vision.when cataracts are removed , the implants that replace the human lens almost all have uv blocker incorporated into the material , so the risk of macular degeneration after cataract extraction doesn â t necessarily increase.i add about 1 teaspoon of goji beeries to a smoothie about once per week , is that sufficient ? i â ve been reading a lot about the hazards of blue light coming from computer monitors ( lcd screens ) and full spectrum light bulbs . it seems to be more dangerous for people who have had cataracts removed . best to wear the yellow tinted blue light filter glasses while working on computers.i see that there are supplements for zeaxanthin. is that helpful for masular degenerationi am sick and tired of reading about high cholesterol allegedly causing heart problems . this is the medicine of the end of the 20th century ! ! good cardiologists like dr sinatra , who also thought of cholesterol as the culprit , his practice made him change his mind back in the 1990s . and there are scores of others . people who have suffered a heart attack , their cholesterol level was high only in 50 % , which means it is not a scientific argument.dr greger in order to bias his vegetarian / vegan views serves us with his theories about eggs causing high cholesterol.dr lair ribeiro , a brazilian eminent cardiologist and nutriologist considers eggs as the most important food after maternal milk . he cannot start a day without eating 3-4 eggs . there are scores of videos on youtube . but unfortunately even first class physicians like dr greger will never understand it without getting rid of their prejudice . such physician should read / see cardiologists like dr sinatra , who laughs his head off when he hears about cholesterol causing heart problems.i wish i had higher cholesterol . ( i have it only slightly above 200 . i eat around 10-12 eggs per week and i cannot reach 250 cholesterol levels . i am probably not human even though i lead a sedentary life . this is the evidence , dr greger . i also love vegetables and fruits and .. fish and meat as well . the last two may sound to you like a red rag to a bull . sorry about that . this is called meditarreanean diet . have you heard of that ? i am not talking about the studies done in the 1950s or 60s , but a recent publication from 2012 . dr greger , if you have an open mind , you should present this study here in your posts instead of cherry picking limiting your mind to only plants . plants are great ! but only plants is the same as relying only on mainstream media and showing big-headedness.richardorichard : re : â people who have suffered a heart attack , their cholesterol level was high only in 50 % , which means â¦ â your conclusion is not logical based on the evidence . what your statistic really means is that the labeling of â high â by traditional medicine is grossly incorrect . or perhaps an even better way of looking at it is : â high â is not a helpful category when an entire population is on average too high . instead , what we want is â safe â levels of cholesterol.so , what we know is that a total cholesterol below 150 and ldl below 70 makes one pretty much heart-attack-proof . but above 150 , a person is in the danger zone . this explains your 50 % statistic . those are people who traditional medicine does not label as high , but in fact who are â high â if by â high â one really means â a level that will lead to hard attacks â .i understand why you think that cholesterol is not relevant . there is a lot of misinformation out there that has convinced people such as yourself that cholesterol does not matter . it sounds like you care deeply about evidence and as you say , cherry picking is not good . if you want to know how the cholesterol denyiers cherry pick and outright twist their evidence , i highly recommend the scholarly work from plant positive . plant positive directly addresses the issues / claims you have been exposed to.http : / / plantpositive.com / thea , thank you for your reply.please tell me why the french have on average 250 cholesterol level ? and it is one of the last nations in western europe who suffer from , cvd . and what is their staple diet ? unfortunately they have problems with cirrhosis â¦ but it is a different story.yes , i was imprecise about high cholesterol . sorry . you have scored a point . but our body needs cholesterol badly ! look , the cholesterol deposits in the arteries is the body â s reaction to help patch up the scars in the arteries due to the mechanical damage ( huge pressure ) chemical damage resulting from scores of other factors â lack of nutrients , toxification , etc.the worst is inflamation , blood inflamation in this case . if it weren â t for the helping hand of the cholesterol we would die from internal bleeding , ! ! ! thank god we have cholesterol ! besides , cholesterol is needed to synthetize vitamin d , whose importance even dr greger talks about . we need it for our hormone production â testosterone , estrogen . every cell needs our cholesterol , and last but not least our brain.do you want to starve your body ? â if so , it is your choice . but before you do it , just open your mind , read at least dr sinatra or just see this http : / / www.heartmdinstitute.com / health-topics / cholesterol / 579-what-s-really-good-and-bad-about-cholesterol . these are only snatches . go deeper . if you want more , i can give you other links.there are scores of cardiologists who follow the same idea . neither of those â pro-cholesterol doctors want us to eat a meat meal 5 times a week , if you have it once or twice a week , you won â t suffer from cholesterol deficiency . that brazilian doctor i mentioned last time is around 70 years old and he looks at most 55 . that â eggs-eater â should have been dead long ago if cholesterol were not a myth . i should have been dead as well.i know it is hard to shake or uinlearn our way of thinking and change it when the evidence is in front of us.sorry , i have to leave you â two soft-boilt eggs are waiting for me.ricardo , you are unfortunately employing the â cholesterol is necessary â argument , a common argument used to support cholesterol rich diets . â given the capability of all tissues to synthesize sufficient amounts of cholesterol for their metabolic and structural needs , there is no evidence for a biological requirement for dietary cholesterol . therefore , neither an adequate intake nor a recommended dietary allowance is set for cholesterol.there is much evidence to indicate a positive linear trend between cholesterol intake and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration , and therefore increased risk of coronary heart disease ( chd ) . a tolerable upper intake level is not set for cholesterol because any incremental increase in cholesterol intake increases chd risk . â http : / / www.nap.edu / openbook.php ? record _ id = 10490 & page = 542there is no dietary need to consume cholesterol . if inflammation is what your worried about , diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol are by far the most inflammatory of all . those 2 hardboiled eggs your eating , as performed in this study , resulted in endothelium impairment after consuming . a clear sign of inflammation. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2904713 / # ! po = 43.1818you can see other mechanisms of inflammation here. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = endotoxemiatoxins , you are unfortunately employing the â cholesterol is not necessary â argument , a common argument used to support non-cholesterol diets.what you say , according to your â scientific data â i should have already been dead , because i have been eating like that all my life . my crp is 0,7 . , triglycerides â 55.you are absolutely right â try writing to dr sinatra or dr mercola or dr m. ali and scores of others â they will laugh at you.i am still alive â the best living proof that your scientific argument is at most theoretical . ldl is also fine as long as it is not oxidized . lp ( a ) is highly inflamatory form of ldl . i am not afraid of it.i hate hard-boilt eggs . where did you take it from ? were you dreaming ? read more closely , please.stick to your non-cholesterol diet and be happy . no wonder , there is no argument to make you see clearly.it is no use debating either with fanatics or with prejudiced people . it is not my job to convince you.have a nice evening . here in europe it is the dead of night . sorry , i have to leave you . long live cholesterol ! : - ) ) ) ricardo , i am not arguing that dietary cholesterol is harmful because we don â t need it . i am arguing that it is harmful to consume and strongly inked with heart disease . your argument that : we need serum cholesterol so we need dietary cholesterol , is illogical . i hope you understand this difference.heart disease takes time to develop . americans eat a high saturated fat , high cholesterol diet but most do not experience heart disease till later in life . â try writing to dr sinatra or dr mercola or dr m. ali and scores of others â they will laugh at you . â should i consider these people nutrition experts and authorities ? what difference does it make if these individuals agree with the science or not . dr. mercola himself is a well known quack and i would hardly consider him a reliable source of information.to say that cholesterol is unrelated to heart disease is to turn a blind eye to the countless studies showing this link and cherry pick a meager few . this is indeed the theme of the video we are commenting on . please look at the evidence coherently . i have seen both sides of this argument and know the arguments people use to support a cholesterol rich diet . i hope you will take the time to truly understand what you are getting yourself into and see the other side of it . here is a good place to clear up the cholesterol confusion. http : / / plantpositive.com / 18-cholesterol-confusion-1-pri / lastly , â hate hard-boilt eggs . where did you take it from ? were you dreaming ? read more closely , please . â came from your comment . â sorry , i have to leave you â two soft-boilt eggs are waiting for me . â i â m sorry , i should have said soft boiled egg instead of hard . i didn â t know there was a difference.toxins , let â s take the argument from a different angle . do names like gregg braden , deepak chopra or rupert sheldrake to name just a few ring a bell in your mind ? especially the last one.there are two aspects , both are based on science â experiments in vitro and experiments in vivo . dr sinatra is a good example of the latter and in point of fact this is what matters â his 35 years of clinical practice.you see , i have lost faith in the so-called science of the 18th century , which we still practise today , even though i myself have a phd ( not in the field ) . the paradigm of what is science and what the science is not , is in the process of a change.if you are a good observer , you must have noticed that there has been a huge uproar against the old-fashioned science and it is still on the increase . the reasons are obvious . delve into sheldrake â s science set free ( american title ) or just watch scores of videos showing how â science â tried to enslave him . his life is a good example . this one is good stuff http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = upccmlgug8a science has turned out to become a religious belief . no wonder there are so many alternative approaches in almost every field , because people are fed up with those egg-headed 18th century individuals who live today . the pure example is richard dawkins . those â scientists â have led themselves to the dead-end street . and they are blocking any development.but our discussion has become something else.returning to the cholesterol issue , there â s hardly a difference if you argue one way or another . for me you are like dr greger limiting himself to showing views that only support a vegetarian or vegan diet . why doesn â t he comment on the recent spanish study on meditarranean diet ? why doesn â t he want to face the reality ? it is not very comfy , is it ? obviously , it isn â t , because his vegetarian diet will have to be scrapped.i have always tried to see both sides of the argument . it gives me pleasure to read nutritionfacts but i don â t wear blinkers , or blinders as you say in america . i remember my being afraid of cholesterol in the 1970s , which did not make me vegetarian . i am omnivore because a human being has always been like that . and i am too old to go into fads.ricardorichard : sorry it took me so long to get back to you.re : â but our body needs cholesterol badly ! â that â s always such an interesting argument to me , because no one i know disputes that our bodies need some amount of cholesterol to function correctly . i would say that it is a strawman argument , except that i think that when people say that , they are really thinking something else and just not being specific.if what you are really suggesting is that our bodies need cholesterol and that the only way to get it is by eating it or that we have to supplement what our bodies make by eating it , then toxins already answered that point . our bodies make all of the cholesterol that we need . no worries there.if you are suggesting that our bodies need cholesterol and therefore there is no way to have too much of it , then i would point out an analogy for you : our bodies also need water . but too much of it can kill you . to think that our bodies can have unlimited amounts of cholesterol without there ever being a problem ( that cholesterol is more special than water ) is against all common sense . i â m not saying you believe this . i â m just making a point.so , there is a limit / line above which too much of the stuff in our veins would be a problem . the question is : where is that line ? we know that when total cholesterol is below 150 and ldl below 70 , people don â t get heart attacks . above that , people get heart attacks . unsafe cholesterol ( ie , above 150 ) is not a guarantee that a person will get a heart attack , but the risk goes way up compared to having safe cholesterol levels.this gets us back to our original points : you stated that 50 % of the people who get heart attacks have low ( or normal ? ) cholesterol . and i explained how the traditional definition of â low â is has been perverted in a society where â normal â is too high to be safe . ie , where normal is to die of heart disease.hope that explanation clarifies my point.sure , it does . but see a human body holistically . you don â t want more cholesterol than 150 because from your point of view it is dangerous for heart attack . and what about your brain , and the production of vitamin d , and other hormones ? if you are happy , lower your cholesterol below 100 , it is your choice . perhaps you will never have a heart attack and that â s great but what about your brain and other hormones and probably sth else that we have not discovered yet ? ricardorichard : the thing is , the healthiest people on the planet , the ones who have sharp minds at 100 + and live long healthy lives , generally have cholesterol below 150 and primarily eat a whole foods plant based diet . ( you can do research on the â blue zone â populations if you want . ) so the specific problems , plus general worries you list ( ie : â â¦ and probably sth else that we have not discovered yet ? â ) are not an issue in practice.in theory , your concern could be a valid one : if someone can have cholesterol that is too high , can we also have cholesterol that is too low ? zero cholesterol is too low . but where is the line ? i â m not aware of anyone , baring some genetic deficiency , whose body isn â t able to make * * * all of the cholesterol that they need . * * * and that â s the point . if you have all that you need , then you have all that you need . ie , not just low enough to avoid heart disease , but high enough to be healthy . the entire point of nutritionfacts.org is to figure out the diet that is most likely to lead to optimum health / disease prevention . baring some terrible problem where a person â s body doesn â t make all of the cholesterol that they need , we don â t have to worry about cholesterol going too low . our bodies make what we need . once that idea really sinks in , the concerns you raise disappear . here is some evidence to back up this point ( click â sources cited â for details if interested ) : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / can-cholesterol-be-too-low / thea , you see , i am very â allergic â to people who are â mono â . i mean , who ar4e specialists in only the right toe of the left foot or who love only one type of music or who talk only about one subject and those who are vegetarian or only meat-eaters or only fish-eaters , or only speak one language , etc etc.a human being must try to develop their full potentiality and nobody will convince me that eating only meat is the best or eating only vegetables is the best and they usually try to support their arguments from their own yard . try to see why being a vegetarian is wrong . there is plenty of material ( not only in english ) instead of convincing yourself of your being right using arguments taken from your like-minded people.i have forgotten before to add that my example of eating eggs is not the only one . there are far more omnivore people than vegetarians or vegans , although it is not a scientific argument to prove you wrong . besides i am far away to convince anybody.for vegetarians cholesterol was a red rag to a bull and therefore they turned vegetarian ( others did it for other reasons , for instance animal-lovers ) , but the whole problem with cholesterol is a hoax.your argument that the body produces sufficient cholesterol is taken from the air . the same we may say that the body produces enough vitamin c ( it does not produce any ) or that it produces enough coq10 or enough hormones.as we know nothing is static and with age there are changes in the level of hormones , etc , etc . so why are you sure that our bodies produce sufficient amount of cholesterol in this case ? perhaps it doesn â t.last but not least i think our life is too short so that we should try ( at least this is my philosophy of life ) and find plenitude in every aspect of our lives to enrich our experience in order to live fully . why should i limit myself to eating only plants ? is it healthy . you say so and your sympathizers , because there is no strong scientific argument that this is true . there is no agreement among doctors and researchers on the issue . fortunately there is still food for us on our planet . we must use it sparingly but taking advantage of everything.how can i â go into nothingness â without drinking different kinds of alcohol , without experiencing hunger or unhappiness ? without experiencing love and happiness ? without eating meat , poultry , fish and eggs , vegetables and fruits ? cholesterol can be as low as the 10 range and you will still live a perfectly healthy life . this is evident in those who have genetic disorders resulting in extremely low cholesterol , thus , the argument that below 150 is too low is simply untrue . i would see this video for the evidence.http : / / plantpositive.com / 22-cholesterol-confusion-5-cho / great , toxins. my advice is you should strive to lower your cholesterol below 10 and you will lead perfectly healthy life . be happy.my point being the â cholesterol is necessary â argument for eating cholesterol is faulty on many levels . i would encourage you to watch the plant positive video i linked if you are truly interested in the evidence.as in my comparison somewhere here , motor vehicles are necessary , but scrap them leaving only 100 in the entire us and so many lives will be spared every year.good luck to you , ricardo.the same to you , toxins.ricardorichard : re : â please tell me why the french have on average 250 cholesterol level ? â i don â t know what the average french cholesterol level is , but i â m willing to accept your number for the moment for the sake of argument . i am aware that the french ( as least historically and maybe still today ) have lower cvd than say americans . so , let â s say this is the â french paradox â : ie , that their cholesterol levels are pretty darn high , but that they have relatively low rates of cvd . so , i think you are asking : how do we explain this apparent â paradox â ? for this , i would refer you to the â asian paradox â : on one hand , we have a bazillion and one studies showing that smoking causes or greatly increases our risk of cancer . on the other hand , we have some asian countries who smoke way more than america does , and yet has way less lung cancer . how do we explain that ? does that mean that smoking doesn â t really cause cancer ? no , smoking really is bad for us . smoking really does greatly increase our risk of getting cancer . what the data means , is that there is another factor at play in the asian countries . as we have seen on nutritionfacts , we are starting to learn what that confounding factor is â by eating a mostly whole food plant based diet , people can do a lot to lower their risk of various cancers , even when they smoke . we do not know the answer to the paradox for sure , but we definitely have enough information about smoking to know that smoking is indeed bad for us , regardless of what happens in some asian countries.the french paradox is likely the same situation , with a third factor mitigating their risk . why would i believe that the french paradox is anything like the asian paradox ? because like the issue of smoking , we have a bazillion and one studies showing that high cholesterol is a big risk factor for heart disease.something to think about.you try hard enough to always slant your explanation to a plant based diet . now i have caught you or rather you have led yourself to the dead-end street . whereas you were lucky to explain the asian paradox with the plant based diet , you are not so lucky to account for the french paradox by using the same method . this time you did not dare to use the same argument â¦ because it was too risky.frankly speaking are you really convinced that a plant based diet slows down or reduces substantially harmful effects of smoking ? if so nutritionfact.org should take worries off the minds of the smokers in the western world as long as they follow a healthy ( in your understanding ) diet . logically thinking it is good idea , isn â t it ? as far as i am concerned i think that there are other factors ( not necessarily a plant-based die ) t that will account for that asian paradox . but one thing is certain â in case of the french as it was not convenient for you , you prefered to abstain from mentioning resveratrol , a phytonutrient found in red wine that is the â culprit â . obviously you couldn â t mention it , because wine is terribly destructive or even poison according to your way of thinking.ricardorichard : there is no great problem here . i didn â t speculate because i have no evidence on the confounding factors behind the french paradox . very simple . i stick to the evidence as best i can . i â m sorry you don â t understand the point i was making.thea , i did understand , i am afraid . do you call evidence , your explanation of the asian paradox ? we may call it only a hypothesis not the evidence . you couldn â t find that evidence in case of the french , because you can â t account for it using vegetarianism or veganism.ricardorichard : to clarify : 1 ) no i did not attempt to explain the asian paradox with strong evidence . what i said is that we are * starting * to understand the why ( with some good evidence ) . what i didn â t say explicitly , but will now is : the â why â is irrelevant . i didn â t have to mention the potential â why â , except that it is so interesting . the main * point * was : â what the data means , is that there is another factor at play in the asian countries . â that â s the point . even if we don â t know the details , we do know that smoking is bad for us . do you really want to argue this point ? 2 ) re : â you couldn â t find â¦ â again , you mistake my meaning . i haven â t even looked for evidence regarding the case of the french paradox . i just don â t care . because what we know is that there * are * one or more confounding factors regarding the french for the reasons i explained above . in other words , just because the french may have higher cholesterol and lower heart attacks does not mean that the french situation wipes out all of the extremely strong science we have linking high cholesterol to heart disease . just like the existence of cancer free , smoking asians do not wipe out all of the very strong evidence that we have linking smoking to cancer . * that â s * the point . that is the answer to what i had believed was an honest question about the french.ad 1 no , i don â t think that smoking is a good and healthy thing . i simply tried to show you how funny your argumentation was.ad 2 you didn â t even try to look for the evidence because it would sound really funny to use the same kind of arguments . it looks that you cannot see the world around outside the vegetarian / vegan diet , which is a â mono â attitude ( i explained that before ) . the world is wider than healthy nutrition.cholesterol accumulating in the arteries is a consequence of the inflammation â without cholesterol the the sore spot of the damaged endothelium cannot be properly covered and protected . total cholesterol is meaningless . there could have some meaningful indications of the problem if you use a spectracell test , because the so-called ldl is not a devil as it is painted.one should devide ldl into small and dense particles . â the latter are really dangerous because they are highly inflammatory . please read more if you can take the information outside your health encyclopedia. http : / / www.heartmdinstitute.com / health-topics / cholesterol / 399-worried-about-cholesterolit is the same as saying that motor vehicles are to be blame for all road accidents . scrap the vehicles or leave only 100 in the entire us and the problem will be solved . and you have solved your problem with cholesterol by lowering it to 150.re : â â¦ wine is terribly destructive or even poison according to your way of thinking . â i don â t know why you think that . i don â t remember every saying any such thing . i certainly don â t think it . do you have me confused with another poster ? or are you making assumptions ? sinply because wine is not in the prescription at nutritionfacts.dot , your health-nutrition encyclopedia . i was disappointed not to see your reply to my argument on the french paradox , which in point of fact is no paradox at all.ricardorichard : re : â that â eggs-eater â should have been dead long ago if cholesterol were not a myth . â this is a strawman argument . the issue under discussion is risks / probabilities . not guarantees . in other words : no one says that high cholesterol * will * give you a heart attack . it just raises your risk dramatically . similarly , no one says that smoking * will * give you cancer . it just raises the risk dramatically.everyone has heard about this or that 100 year old who smokes a pack a day every day for the last 80 years and never got cancer . so , when you smoke , you takes your changes . who knows , you may be that lucky one . similarly , there are people who eat 3 eggs a day every day for 80 years and low and behold , no heart attacks , no diabetes , etc . that â s great for them . but the majority of people were not so lucky â¦ that â s the point.re : â i should have been dead as well . â i â m glad you are still alive to have this conversation . : - ) lucky person ! with all my best wishes , i hope your luck continues.thea , thank you for wishing me well . i am not a doctor but i have been reading a lot what clinical practice of cardiologists says and especially those who link their research with their practice and i am only repeating their argument . but those who have closed mind don â t want to hear that . that â s the point . even a probability does not enter into play , because the root problem is not cholesterol but inflammation and cholesterol only helps to patch up the hurt part of the endothelium . all the best to yuou as well.to add onto thea â s thorough response , this video highlights the cholesterol discrepancy here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / when-low-risk-means-high-risk / oh yah ! i forgot about that one . there is just so much great info on this site , i can â t keep it all in my head . thanks for that link . if nothing else , i appreciate it . : - ) i just wanted to correct the claim that dr. greger is not familiar with the mediterranean diet and inflammation factors and their effects on heart attack risk . witness this video from 2003 or so that i think predates the nutrition facts website.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = q7kerwdih04note that greger is actually a proponent of the idea that inflammation can be harmful as you can see from a variety of videos on this site , and his quote in the video above concerning the â recommended diet â vs the mediterranean diet in the post heart attack study is interesting.hello , sf-jeff . what i meant was dr greger â s comments on the latest study done in spain in 2012 i believe.thanks for the video . somehow it had passed me by . i like all his videos , his excellent research and his lively way of presentation except that he is prejudiced against everything which is not vegan / vegetarian ( talking about nutrition ) . he never said a pleasant word in relation to meat-eaters and even fish-eaters . they are a total disaster . he uses their achievements to correct vegan / vegetarian diet . this is not an honest and detached attitude required of a researcher.as for inflammation , he is not consequent . saturated fats are not inflammatory . they do not go rancid even in room temperature . ( it does not mean we must stuff our face with it , bnut consuming from time to time will not send you to an early grave ) . dr sinatra and the growing numbers of doctors do not reject meat . and the mediterranean diet is also meat ( not only fish and vegetables and olive oil ) although the video you advised me to watch is from 2003 but dr greger remains unyielding today . still the same blames on cholesterl , etc . see some dr sinatra â s videos on the topic.it is true that milk does not contain proper calcium for humans , but look , for the last 300 ? 400 ? years babies have been fed on milk . only for the last 50 yeasrs when pasteurization became a common practice â milk has lost its qualities . and it is not a scientific argument used not only by dr greger , namely that it is a strange case that only humans drink other animal â s milk . ( it is not true , because cats and dogs drink also cow â s milk , not to mention pigs ) . what â s wrong in drinking goat â s milk ? now returning to raw milk will probably put a human evolution back on the right track.take the example of the french and swiss concerning cheese . they should be dropping dead like flies because of high cholesterol and saturated fat.concerning other things , most probably already updated by dr greger , canola is a hydrogenated rape seed oil , which means it is an artificial trans fat â according to dr ribeiro . besides 400 iu of vitamin d should be updated to 4 or 5 thousand . meat-eaters don â t have to worry about b12 supplements because of homocysteine levels . i was surprised that he did not mention magnesium or coq10 even in 2003.i will probably refrain from commenting on the nutritional items you bring up , but i will say that it looks like we have quite a different view on evolution.some people think of evolution as a ladder , with humans at the top of the ladder . i prefer to think of evolution as a bush , with species only become more extreme in one access because of greater variability and random chance . the most successful organism on the planet by far is undoubtedly either the bacteria or viruses . they will be around long after humans are gone . we are enormously inefficient by comparison , with just a small fraction of our energies going into creating the next generation.based on this worldview i don â t really see any meaning in the following : â now returning to raw milk will probably put a human evolution back on the right track . â please read my word â evolution â as development . what i meant was that if we started to drink cow â s milk some 300 ? or 200 ? years ago , we must have accepted this development and adapted it into our evolution in a micro-scale . pasteurization upset our apple-cart for some 50 years roughly speaking ( problems with allergies , etc ) and those serious tendencies towards drinking raw milk , i called them putting a human development back on the right track , ie to resume what had been stopped . i still remember there was fresh milk widely available in europe in the 1970s and 1980s . if you left it outside a fridge , it would get sour in 48 hours in the room temperature . now it is milk + chemicals which don â t allow the milk to get sour and this must be the cause of allergies to milk and to dairy products.personally i have never been fond of milk or cheese , so i am not defending my preferences . but i see what happens around me . could you imagine babies not drinking cow â s milk in post-industrial countries even this milk full of chemicals ? if you are more into evolution , please don â t tell me that human being never ate meat and meat consumption is the invention of the consumer society . as far as i know , man never stopped consuming meat from other animals . and if that has any pejorative connotations ( by analogy to millk consumption ) , perhaps we should call for cannibalism â it will be healthier â¦ do you really think that man started off with a plant diet ? so i don â t understand where the problem lies . according to dr brian clement cancer and cvd were little known 120 years ago . and suddenly these diseases fell on us because of meat and cholesterol ? concerning simple carbs , yes , i do agree â they contributed tremendously.suddenly meat and poultry and eggs are the culprit of our bad nutrition ? evolution only gets one vote on your entire genotype per generation . this means â bad â genes can stick around for thousands of generations . think of the problem we have in the voting box where we choose between 1 democrat and 1 republican times a thousand . evolution can â t solve lactose intolerance in a thousand years any more than we can change page 47 of the trans pacific partnership treaty in the voting booth . many of our genes are here not because they in any way help us in modern times , but rather because they helped us ( well , some of us ) survive the last ice age.i honestly don â t know whether meat eating was healthy 10,000 years ago , but it â s kind of an exaggeration to say that eating chicken , pig , or cow today is the same as eating meat 10000 years ago . here are a couple links : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / where-does-the-fat-come-from-in-a-skinless-chicken-breast / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 09 / 23 / will-the-real-paleo-diet-please-stand-up / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-eating-obesity-cause-obesity / if lactose intolerance is innate so far as human beings are concerned , i am not human . besides , i know a person who is now in her mid-50s and she drinks 1l of milk every day . and she has been doing that all her life and has been healthy all the time . her first visit to a dentist happened when she was â¦ in her mid-30s ! ! ! probably she is not human either â¦ moreover â my kids drank more or less the same amount each until they were in their late teens without any major or minor health issues , because of my stupidity â i simply did not know about a serious problem of lactose intolerance . i did not hear of sth like that in my surrounding . today i would not let them do it if they had been born again.i don â t argue your theoretical knowledge of evolution you have brought forward . but what are the practical results ? take the meditarreanean diet . problems start when you overeat stuffing yourself with meat every day . but if you eat two or three meat meals a week ( with lots of vegetables and flushing it with a glass or two of red wine , nothing will happen . what is wrong is that in spain / portugal they have such a meal sometimes at 11 pm or at midnight â they usually don â t have breakfast except for an expresso .. no wonder they still feel full when they wake up next day . and cvd and obesity is on the rise there as well but that is due to the abuse of meat and they love over-eating . â if lactose intolerance is innate so far as human beings are concerned , i am not human . â what point are you trying to make ? i was making the point that evolution doesn â t have precise control over genotypes . a lot of what we have today is just dumb luck . you sound as if i am attacking your diet with the above comments when i was doing no such thing . â take the meditarreanean diet . problems start when you overeat stuffing yourself with meat every day . but if you eat two or three meat meals a week ( with lots of vegetables and flushing it with a glass or two of red wine , nothing will happen . â i don â t see a problem with that . if you look at the links i provided above , chicken has far more fat and salt in it today than it did 100 years ago , and can potentially have higher fat levels than ice cream ( although i really should second source that claim ) , but if you eat a healthy diet , then small amounts of things that are â bad for you â can be good for you because of the variety and balance that they add.precicely â â variety and balance â your golden words . at last we are at one ! i even have a hamburger once a year . and i love it ! i did not think you were attacking me . why should i ? by the way , what is a healthy diet ? in dr greger â s opinion , my diet is not healthy . â cut the middlehen â ha ! i do love gogi berries and they would rank high on my daily berry list if not for this one fact : consuming them at the rate i need , is too low an roi â return on investment , due to the high level of mold in retail-purchased gogi berries . i have tried upwards of a dozen sources , from high-end to the top online suppliers , and none are free of visible mold . the only way i can eliminate this high dose of mold from gogi ( and other berries , nuts , and some whole roots and mushrooms ) so that i can use it in a medicine drink for example , is to put every gogi berry through my boiling water flash bath , friction , and wipe-down . this is why i am not able to utilize gogi along with the other dozen or so berries i use every day for my medicine drink made in blender with hemp or almond milk . the next time you see gogi berries in the bin at your local bulk supply store , you might want to examine them very closely . and if you switch to online suppliers for your gogi , and find one that does not pass off highly moldy gogi , please let us know ! it appears that gogi is another of the must have medicine foods we might have to put into the grow your own category ! tried 2 different brands of goji berries , but cannot digest them ( gas , stomach discomfort ) . read a great many people have the same issue with goji berries . any way around this ? i â ve never heard of that issue . i guess the best way to avoid any discomfort is to not eat them . plenty of other foods that contain eye-protecting nutrients. aging , blindness , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chicken , cholesterol , eggs , eye disease , eye health , fat , glaucoma , goji berries , heart disease , heart health , ldl cholesterol , lettuce , lutein , macular degeneration , nuts , organic foods , oxidative stress , phytonutrients , poultry , seeds , spinach , vegetables , vision , zeaxanthin - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-67: how beans help our bones health authorities from all over the world universally recommend increasing the consumption of whole grains and legumes â beans , split peas , chickpeas , and lentils â for health promotion . but what about the phytates ? phytate is a naturally occurring compound found in all plant seeds ( like beans , grains , and nuts ) that over the decades has been maligned as mineral absorption inhibitors . that â s why , for example , one hears advice to roast , sprout , or soak your nuts to get rid of the phytates so we can absorb more minerals , like calcium . the concern about phytates and bone health arose from a series of laboratory experiments performed on puppies published in 1949 , which suggested that high phytate diets have a bone softening and anti-calcifying effect . subsequent studies on rats , in which they fed them the equivalent of ten loaves of bread a day , â confirmed â phytate â s status as a so-called anti-nutrient . but more recently , in the light of actual human data , phytate â s image has undergone a makeover . a recent study published in the journal of medicinal food asked a simple question : do people who avoid high phytate foods â legumes , nuts , and whole grains â have better bone mineral density ? no . those that consumed more high-phytate foods actually had stronger bones , as measured in the heel , spine and hip . the researchers conclude that dietary phytate consumption had protective effects against osteoporosis and that low phytate consumption should actually be what â s considered an osteoporosis risk factor . a follow-up study , measuring phytate levels flowing through women â s bodies and following bone mass over time , found the same thing : women with the highest phytate levels had the lowest levels of bone loss in the spine and hip . those who ate the most phytates were also estimated to have a significantly lower risk of major fracture , and a lower risk of hip fracture specifically . this is consistent with reports that phytate can inhibit the dissolution of bone similar to anti-osteoporosis drugs like fosamax . phytates don â t have the side effects , though , such as osteonecrosis ( bone death ) associated with that class of drugs . people take these drugs to protect their bones , but by doing so may also risk rotting them away ( see phytates for the prevention of osteoporosis ) . eating healthy can help us avoid other drugs as well . see , for example : beans might not just help our skeleton last longer , but the rest of us as well . see increased lifespan from beans . how might one boost mineral absorption ? see new mineral absorption enhancers found . alkaline diets , animal protein , & calcium loss is another surprising video on bone health . and more on the benefits of phytates can be found in my videos : what about the high phosphorous amounts in beans , compared to calcium in beans ? can excess phosphorous in relation to calcium prevent adequate calcium uptake ? data on amino acid supplements for vegans ? harmful , harmless ? natural , un-natural ? does beans inclure soy and tofu ? dr. greger â do you need to update your â new mineral absorption enhancers found â info in light of the above ? that video states : â one of those phytonutrients though , phytates , or phytic acid â¦ can partially inhibit mineral absorption â¦ but because it binds up some of the minerals , that just means one just have to eat more whole healthy plant foods â or eat mineral absorption enhancers â so should we no longer be soaking our grains prior to cooking ? if phytates have been found to have a beneficial effect , it would seem that soaking grains ( in a slightly acid medium ) to reduce phytates is not something we should be doing , right ? if you eat enough legumes and grains daily , you should get some phytates in your system even if you soak and cook them . i bet it is still better not to get too much phytates , but small amounts are beneficial.ip-6 / inositol hexaphosphayte ( aka phytic acid , phytate ) was demonstrated by dr. shamsuddin and others in peer-reviewed research ( he also has two books available on amazon â see links below ) back in the late 1980 â s and 1990 â s to be a helpful aspect of human nutrition , and not an â anti-nutrient â as it was dubbed early on . one can think of it as in one way , a powerful regulator of certain nutrients ( e.g. heme iron ) where too much can indeed be harmful to the human body , and in this sense , it is a selective nutrient â regulator â , not â anti â .one of the potential aspects that beans , legumes , grains , seeds , etc . , are considered healthy , and may help keep cancer at bay ( in addition to fiber ) is their content of ip6and how ip6 is converted in the body to ip3 , which helps in cellular signalling . this is particularly interesting with regards to immature cancer cells , which â fail to grow up â to become the mature cell they were meant to be . with large doses of ip6 / inositol treatment , these cells then are responsive to this signalling and then differentiate.he also developed and advanced early-detection colon cancer screening based on his work.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 9244360. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17044765 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 14608114 ( free full text ) http : / / www.amazon.com / s / ref = nb _ sb _ noss ?

            "Query PLAIN-77: phosphate additives in chicken banned elsewhere in my video phosphate additives in meat purge and cola , i talked about the danger of phosphorus additives in food . however , when surveyed , most future medical professionals were insufficiently aware â in fact , two-thirds had no clue â of the risks related to prolonged high dietary phosphate intake . even if they knew it was a problem , they didn â t know which foods had added phosphates . 99 % knew that sugar was added to soda , but only 7 % knew that phosphates were added . i bet even fewer knew that it â s injected into most packages of meat . though this practice remains banned in europe , 11 different phosphate salts are currently allowed to be injected into meat and poultry in the united states . this despite the fact that phosphate is considered an arterial toxin â causing our arteries to stiffen up within just two hours of consumption . phosphate additives may also make poultry more dangerous from a food safety standpoint . phosphate additives may increase the number of campylobacter bacteria in chicken exudates . chicken exudate is the same as poultry purge ( colloquially known as chicken â juice â ) , â the fluid that seeps out from processed poultry carcasses and is often found to be contaminated with considerable numbers of campylobacter bacteria . it is comprised of water , blood , fats , and other materials added to the poultry during processing . â if chicken isn â t injected with phosphate , the exudates seeping into the package may grow about 100 campylobacter bacteria . but , add some phosphate to the carcass , and up to a hundred million bacteria may grow . why does adding phosphate to poultry increase the number of campylobacter bacteria ? it may be because phosphates increase the survival of campylobacter â by 100 fold or more . the infectious dose for campylobacter has been shown to be as little as 500 organisms . how much might there be in chicken ? 100,000 can be easily recovered from washes of whole chicken carcasses . so what does a million times more food-poisoning bacteria mean for the risk to consumers ? a mere hundred fold increase in these fecal matter bacteria can mean a thirty fold difference in the number of human outbreaks of campylobacter , which can leave patients paralyzed ( see my video poultry and paralysis ) . but , if the poultry industry doesn â t add phosphates , how are they ( in their words ) going to â enhance the moisture absorbance , color , and flavor of the meat and reduce product shrinkage ? â other concerning additives used by the meat industry include asthma-type drugs ( ractopamine in pork ) , bacteria-eating viruses ( viral meat spray ) , larvae ( maggot meat spray ) , arsenic in chicken , nitrosamines ( prevention is better than cured meat ) , and antibiotics ( drug residues in meat ) . since phosphate additives don â t have to be listed on the nutrition label , how do we avoid them ? all in my video how to avoid phosphate additives . aren â t nuts , seeds , beans etc. high in phosphorous ? we say those are good for our arteries . confused ! the phosphorous in these foods isn â t absorbed very well , while 100 % of phosphorous added to meats is absorbed . watching dr. greger â s video â phosphate additives in meat purge and cola â should clear up any confusion. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola / i love you dr michaeli â ll watch the video but why do i eat foods where i don â t absorb the nutrients . how do i decide what is enough or worse too much.nature has a way of given you what you need and holding back what you don â t need . the added chemicals in food is too much . they throw off homeostasis in the body . you will absorb the phosphorus you need from plant-based foods and the phosphorus you don â t need will not be highly bioavailable.no ! ! ! not my favorite chicken please . i â ll take this as a wake up call . does this mean going with organic helps ? coz , i â m thinking just by the looks of the food at our local grocery , it may seem fresh . but i really couldn â t tell which ones to consider . perhaps , sticking with the greens is better . not to mention , i have also learned from http : / / www.thehemorrhoidcurecenter.com / how good these vegetables are.andrea : re : â i â ll take this as a wake up call . â that â s a great idea , because this is only way in which your chicken is so bad for your health . you can learn the other ways by doing some research on this site.but , â perhaps , sticking with the greens is better . â no need to limit yourself so severely ! greens are part of just one of the 4 main food groups ! : fruit , veggies , grains , and legumes . the other two food groups which should be eaten in moderation ( 1-2 oz / day ) are : seeds and nuts . here are dr. greger â s nutrition recommendations for optimal health : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / note the lack of any meat , dairy and eggs â regardless of whether or not the products are organic . you can learn all the reasons why on this site . it really is an eye opener . i hope you are able to use this information to start eating healthy . you will find that you can eat lots of really great yummy foods . let me know if you would like some practical advice on how to get started.hi thea . thank goodness you â re not taking eggs away from me . i have started having enough green , eggs , lean pork , and bananas . so far , my body has been doing better . i feel so much better now.andrea : i have no interest in taking any food away from anyone . but it seems like there is a misunderstanding . so , just to clarify was i was explaining to you : i was strongly recommending that you remove all meat , dairy and eggs from your diet in order to maximize your health probabilities . eggs are especially bad , as you can see in the videos and articles on this site.anyway , i â m glad you are feeling better . good luck.interesting read . are there any official documents that confirm phosphates are banned in europe or other countries ?

            "Query PLAIN-90: how to boost the benefits of exercise we all know exercise is beneficial to our health . then why is it that ultramarathon runners may generate so many free radicals during a race that they can damage the dna of a significant percentage of their cells ? researchers have looked at the exercise-induced increase in free radical production as a paradox : why would an apparently healthy act â exercise â lead to detrimental effects through damage to various molecules and tissues ? this arises out of somewhat of a misunderstanding : exercise in and of itself is not necessarily the healthy act â it â s the recovery after exercise that is so healthy , the whole â that-which-doesn â t-kill-us-makes-us-stronger â notion . for example , exercise training has been shown to enhance antioxidant defenses by increasing the activities of our antioxidant enzymes . so , during the race ultra-marathoners may be taking hits to their dna , but a week later they can experience great benefits , as shown in my video , enhanced athletic recovery without undermining adaptation . in a recent study , researchers from oregon state university looked at the level of dna damage in athletes . six days after a race , athletes didn â t just go back to the baseline level of dna damage , but had significantly less , presumably because they had revved up their antioxidant defenses . so , maybe exercise-induced oxidative damage is beneficial , similar to vaccination . by freaking out the body a little , we might induce a response that â s favorable in the long run . this concept , that low levels of a damaging entity can up-regulate protective mechanisms , is known as hormesis . for example , herbicides kill plants , but in tiny doses may actually boost plant growth , presumably by stressing the plant into rallying its resources to successfully fight back . wait a second , though . could eating anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant rich plant foods undermine this adaptation response ? we know that berries may reduce inflammatory muscle damage ( see reducing muscle soreness with berries ) , and greens may reduce free radical dna damage ( see preventing exercise induced oxidative stress with watercress ) . dark chocolate and tomato juice appear to have similar effects . how it works is that flavonoid phytonutrients in fruits , vegetables , and beans seem to inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase , considered the main contributor of free radicals during exercise . and the carbs in plant foods may also decrease stress hormone levels . so in 1999 , a theoretical concern was raised . maybe all that free radical stress from exercise is a good thing , and increased consumption of some antioxidant nutrients might interfere with these necessary adaptive processes . if we decrease free radical tissue damage , maybe we won â t get that increase in activity of those antioxidant enzymes . a group of researchers who performed a study on tart cherry juice and recovery following a marathon responded to this antioxidant concern by suggesting that , although it is likely that muscle damage , inflammation , and oxidative stress are important factors in the adaptation process , minimizing these factors may improve recovery so we can train more and perform better . so , there are theories on both sides , but what happens when we actually put it to the test ? while antioxidant or anti-inflammatory supplements may prevent these adaptive events , researchers found that blackcurrant extract â although packed with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties â actually boosted the health benefits of regular exercise . if we take antioxidant pills â vitamin c and vitamin e supplements â we can also reduce the stress levels induced by exercise , but in doing so we block that boost in antioxidant enzyme activity caused by exercise . now maybe we don â t need that boost if we don â t have as much damage , but vitamin c supplements seem to impair physical performance in the first place . with plant foods , though , we appear to get the best of both worlds . for example , lemon verbena , an antioxidant-rich herbal tea , protects against oxidative damage and decreases the signs of muscular damage and inflammation , without blocking the cellular adaptation to exercise . in a recent study , researchers showed that lemon verbena does not affect the increase of the antioxidant enzyme response promoted by exercise . on the contrary : antioxidant enzyme activity was even higher in the lemon verbena group . in my video , enhanced athletic recovery without undermining adaptation , you can see the level of antioxidant enzyme activity before and after 21 days of intense running exercises in the control group . with all that free radical damage , the body started cranking up its antioxidant defenses . but give a dark green leafy tea , and not only do we put a kabosh on the damage due to all the phytonutrients and antioxidants , but we still get the boost in defenses â in fact , in this case , the boost was even greater . find out more on enhancing athletic recovery in this three-part video series : 1 . reducing muscle fatigue with citrus 2 . reducing muscle soreness with berries 3 . preventing exercise-induced oxidative stress with watercress i â m curious if this might be more a question of dose than source . so far as i know , the studies which have shown a negative effect from vitamin c supplementation have all used 1000 mg , or well above the rda . you â d be hard pressed to eat anywhere near that , of course , but if you did , might the results be the same ? i think it â s possible , at least , considering studies with 100-200 mg of supplemental vitamin c haven â t shown any detrimental effects . as ever , too much is as bad as too little . the dose makes both the poison and medicine.another study to this same point : enhanced immune system , and decreased oxidative stress with increased fruit and veggie consumption : http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / 137 / 12 / 2737.full.pdf + htmlexcellent review ! man i love this stuff.or it could be plant is toxic in itself so it become hoemesis substance by itself like exercise.probably my favorite series of subjects on the website . demonstrates the absolute perfection of using natural foods as they are , and sticking with whole food plants.a recent study at , i believe the university of tx , suggested that aerobic exercise improves health by increasing autophagy . i â m guessing this might be a prime factor in helping to clean up the damaged dna . adding the phytonutrients i would suppose reduces the damage to begin with.it â s much easier to run my 6 miles when i know what good it â s doing me . just had my watermelon so gotta do my run.i found this article confusing . so , do we take the dark green leafy tea right after exercising ? what type of tea ? i appreciate all the background , but would love a succinct course of action provided at the end that i can skip to when some of the material is beyond my brain capacity or i â m short on time . thank you ! yes ! i was waiting for that too . isn â t that why we read the â experts â anyway ? succinct truths are my quest : ) i have found that just being a vegan made recovery from exercise much better . then when i adopted the raw â til 4 diet , my recovery went through the roof ! i am 55 and i am so amazed at the things my body will now tolerate in terms of being able to do new activities and not suffer the stiff muscles the next day . i have not gone to a gym and done any body building mind you , but i have done plenty of other stuff . i love it ! on a related topic i heard about this concept of metabolic efficiency recently for endurance athletes like marathons and beyond . the idea was to encourage the use of fat as fuel rather than glycogen so that glycogen stores would last longer during running / cycling , reducing the need for topping up with so much â sugar â during the exercise . the argument was don â t carbohydrate load pre-race . carbohydrate produces a spike in sugar in blood , brings insulin , which stops fat burning . go for protein first like yoghurt and fruit for 2 hours before a big event rather than a bowl of porridge . it was also stated that after a couple of weeks of eating like this you could have an 80 % increase in fat burning as opposed to glycogen burning and long slow runs provided the other 20 % potential improvement . i was interested in this topic as a way of improving my performance , reducing tiredness in later stages of say a marathon , but this talk was predicated on eating animal products . i am a vegan so essentially live on complex carbohydrates fruit and veggies ( and as we know there is plenty of protein ) . i wondered what dr greger thought of this metabolic efficiency idea in terms of fat burning and if there has been work done on it in relation to vegans ? yes , i agree that many of the videos are great , but i am left with not knowing exactly what i should or should not do based on the studies . please give us clear directions .. ex . â so when you exercise , make sure you do abc and def to minimize the oxidative stress â . thank you. antioxidants , beans , berries , beverages , cherries , chocolate , currants , dna damage , exercise , flavonoids , fruit , fruit juice , greens , herbal tea , hormesis , inflammation , juice , lemon verbena , muscle health , muscle inflammation , oxidative stress , plant-based diets , supplements , tea , tomato juice , tomatoes , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians , vitamin c , vitamin e - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-101: how to treat multiple sclerosis with diet multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and frightening degenerative autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in which our body attacks our own nerves . it often strikes in the prime of life and can cause symptoms in the brain , such as cognitive impairment ; in the eye , such as painful loss of vision ; as well as tremors , weakness , loss of bladder control , pain , and fatigue . the most frequently prescribed drug for multiple sclerosis is interferon beta , which can make one feel lousy and cost $ 30,000 a year . but hey , it might be worthwhile â if it actually worked . we learned recently that it doesn â t seem to prevent or delay long-term disability . that leaves chemo drugs like mitoxantrone that causes irreversible heart damage in one out of every eight people who go on the drug and causes cancer ( leukemia ) in nearly 1 % of people who take it . but ms is no walk in the park either . if only there was a cheap , simple , safe , side-effect free solution that also just so happened to be the most effective treatment for ms ever prescribed â¦ dr. roy swank , who we lost recently at age 99 , was a distinguished neurologist whose research culminated in over 170 scientific papers . in the video , treating multiple sclerosis with the swank ms diet , i highlight a few . as far back as 1950 , we knew there were areas in the world that had a lot of ms â north america , europe â and other places â africa and asia â that hardly had any . and migration studies show that those who move from a high risk area to a low risk area significantly drop their risk , and vice versa . so it seems less genetic and more lifestyle . dr. swank had an idea . as he recounts in an interview with dr. john mcdougall at the ripe young age of 84 , â it seemed possible to me that this could be a matter of food , because the further north you go the less vegetarian a life is led and the more people are carnivores , you might say â they spend a lot more time eating meat . â after looking at the multiple sclerosis data from world war ii in occupied countries where meat and dairy were rationed , along with his famous study in â 52 that found that the frequency of ms related directly to the amount of saturated animal fat consumed daily in different areas of norway , he concluded that it might be the animal fat that was causing the increased risk . he decided to put it to the test by restricting people â s intake of saturated animal fat , most commonly coming from dairy and chicken in the u.s. ( see trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero ) . in treating multiple sclerosis with the swank ms diet , you can see data on his first 47 patients before cutting out about 90 % of the saturated fat from their diet and after , showing a decrease in both the frequency and severity of ms attacks . normally , we â re lucky if we can get people to stick to a diet for six months , and so that â s why most dietary trials last a year at the most . the first study he published reported results from the first three and a half years . then came the five and a half year follow-up in which he added about another 100 patients . then the seven year follow-up , published in the annals of internal medicine . then the 20 year follow-up , and then the 34 year follow-up . how did his patients do ? if we can get to people early in their disease , when they â re only mildly disabled , and restrict their saturated fat intake , dr. swank showed he could stop their disease in 95 % of cases â no further disability 34 years later . but if they started slacking on their diet â even years in , their disease could become reactivated . they felt so great that some felt that they could cheat a little bit , since they had their disease so well under control . but eating just eight grams of saturated fat more a day was accompanied by a striking increase in disability and a near tripling of their death rate . how about a 50 year follow-up ! they were able to track down 15 of the original patients that stuck to the diet , now in their 70s and 80s , with multiple sclerosis for over 50 years , and 13 out of 15 were walking around normal in all respects . conclusion : â this study indicated that , in all probability , ms is caused largely by consumption of saturated animal fat . â dr. swank thought it was the sludging of the blood caused by even a single meal of saturated fats that can clog tiny capillaries that feed our nervous system . diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol can thicken the blood and make our red cells sticky . a single meal of sausage and eggs can stick our blood cells together like rolls of quarters . and that kind of hyperaggregation can lead to a reduction of blood flow and oxygenation of our tissues . what â s in sausage and eggs that may cause so much inflammation ? see my video series on endotoxins described in my blog how does meat cause inflammation ? if we put someone â s blood through a machine that sucks out about 90 % of the cholesterol in their blood , we can demonstrate an immediate improvement in microcirculation in the heart muscle . but what about the brain ? the eyes are the windows â¦ to our brain . we can visualize â in real-time â changes in blood vessel function in the retina at the back of the eye , which gives us a sense of what â s happening further back in the brain . and if we lower the cholesterol level in the blood , we can immediately get a significant improvement in vasodilation â the little veins open wider and let the blood flow . so yes , it could be the animal fat leading to clogging of our capillaries , but now we know animal fats can have all sorts of other deleterious effects such as inflammation , so who knows what the actual mechanism may be by which cutting animal fat can cut ms progression . regardless , patients with ms that follow a diet with no more than 10 or 15 grams of saturated fat can expect to survive and thrive to a ripe old age . of course , cutting out saturated fat completely might be better , given that heart disease is our number one killer . the bottom line is that the results dr. swank published remain â the most effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ever reported in the peer reviewed medical literature . â in patients with early stage ms , 95 % were without progression of their disease 34 years later after adopting his low saturated fat dietary program . even patients with initially advanced disease showed significant benefit . to date , no medication or invasive procedure has ever even come close , to demonstrating such success . doesn â t cost $ 30,000 dollars ; doesn â t give you leukemia â and works . better ! this all begs one big obvious question : if dr. swanks results are â so stunningly impressive , why haven â t other physicians , neurologists , and centers adopted this method of treatment ? â one reason may be that mri machines weren â t invented until the 1970s , decades after dr. swank â s study began . mris are how we track the progress of ms today . we don â t have to rely on patients â subjective reports or doctor â s clinical judgments , we can see the disease get better or worse right there in black and white . it â s like in the 1970s when nathan pritikin appeared to reverse heart disease by the thousands but no one took him seriously until angiography was invented and the likes of ornish and esselstyn ( see our number one killer can be stopped ) could hold up angiographic images , proving conclusively that a plant-based diet could help literally open up arteries . so what we need is someone to repeat swank â s experiment today with mri scans every step of the way . and i â m happy to report that exact experiment was just completed by dr. john mcdougall . dr. swank was one of dr. mcdougall â s heroes , and dr. mcdougall is one of mine . study enrollment was completed last year and we should have the full results soon . i touched on this in my live 2013 year-in-review lecture more than an apple a day , but i â m excited to be able to take a deeper dive into this extraordinary story . those interested in supporting dr. mcdougall â s landmark study ( headed by dr. dennis bourdette , m.d. and under the supervision of dr. vijayshree yadav ) can donate to his nonprofit mcdougall research & education foundation ( you can also donate to nutritionfacts.org to help keep us bringing you similarly underreported yet life-saving science ) . this is exciting information for those with ms. i am wondering , however , if there is any recent information that would help those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . i understand there is currently a study program in place testing a product called pirfinidone . if you have any information on this or any other study , including , of course , diet , that would benefit those with ipf , it would be greatly appreciated since few people with ipf survive longer than eight years , and someone very near and dear to me is struggling with this condition.systemic enzymes are fantastic for lysing any type of fibrosis in the body . they are taken on an empty stomach so they can be absorbed. http : / / www.totalityofbeing.com / framelesspages / articles / copdandpulmonaryfibrosis.htmthank you for this information . i will definitely look into it.the reason for the lack of interest by both the public and medical profession could be that diet is not considered relevant to ms. outside heartburn and allergies , diet is still a fringe treatment to most medical professionals , who use sound bytes rather than research to determine what to prescribe . the research here is clear and the sound bytes override it , to the detriment of all but the most intelligent public who read nutritionfacts.org.someone needs to do a study on essential tremor like these ms studies . i â ve been using a whole-food , plant-based diet for years to manage et and believe it is not progressing . if we can stop the progression of et with diet , it would help tens of millions of people . please , some of you clinical nutritionists , put some of your et patients on a plant-based diet and lets find out if it stops the progression . the typical et patient gets 10 % worse tremor symptoms each year . it should be easy after a few years to tell if the diet is effective.dr. terry wahls cured her severe ms with a paleo diet . nine cups of fruits and vegetables per day , no dairy , no gluten and clean living.i was granted my medical doctorate with honor with the work i did on ms. 1 / the target is oligodendrocyte , the cell producing myeline , and wrapping more than 1 axon , protecting the neuron and the neuro-transmission . it is a disease reversible starting in blood , entering the blood brain barrier through an inflammatory reaction from may different origins , 2 / creating an inflammatory reaction before destroying an oligodendrocyte which is the key point of reversibility . when you understand this first step , you start to eat organic , to have 60 % or more in vegetables to get enough antioxydant , to have good fat as avocados to be sure to maintain a balance without reaction . the japanese people living japanese style have no ms , it is not genetic , they have ms when in europe or the us , nutrition looks as the key . the work i did between 1974 to 1985 has inspired more work , all scientific data and lifestyle changes are consistent with a response by the brain cells to an agent brought from the blood from nutriments.great work , thanks . is there also a link between diet and motor neuron disease ? i â ve read something about a role for the myelin sheath in that disease too.yes , i did a very extensive work on japanese diet and neurology . all concerning the myelin look better when having a rich anti oxidant food , virgin cold pressed fat oil , no addition of sugar and twice or more portion of fish a week. to say it in simple word , neuro transmission , moto neurons included needs to have active signal , nothing must interfere , simple and rich food as japanese , or real mediterranean are protecting the neuro transmission bringing the elements needed without shutting down the signals , we need phospholipids , clean onesare omega 3s from flax seeds ok instead of fish ? just i did not answer your question , excuse me , i was with the nutrition . oligodendrocytes are the cells making the myelin sheath in a sort of knitting / woven work . i worked on the interaction of the cells to build this sheath around the axon and protect the conduction and the neurotransmission . each part of axon is wrapped by different pieces coming from different cells as if one is damaged the portion of neuron is protected by an other one coming from another cell , security is in place . the ms is the destruction of this myelin sheath , there are phase of inflammation , that makes neuro signs reversible and phase of destruction and then it is scares , we have less chance to reverse , whatever the plasticity of the brain cells , oligodendrocytes included can do migration to repair the damaged portioni had carbon monoxide poisoning at 1 1 / 2 years of age which led me with lesions in my brain â¦ at age 69 i have symptoms of ms and veggies and eating well really helps , i had symptoms all along , tiredness , tingling , numbness , incontinence , etc and never made the connection to co2 poisoning â¦ even though i have these problems i am relieved to know it was probably caused by an accident at an early age â¦ i deal better this way .. before it was just fear if unknown.an accident as you had may be responsible of the signs you describe . i was ordering water gym , to my patients having an acute accident to avoid progressive worsening due to pain when moving. at 69 you know how to deal with it and limit the discomfort.and what about dr. terry wahls , who reversed her secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis with a micronutrient-dense diet and paleo principles ? according to her , some meat , some animal saturated fats , eggs are essential for treating ms with diet : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = f2ya3qpddlm ( dr. terry wahls â protocol that reversed multiple sclerosis ) i was wondering the same thing â¦ i â m reading dr wahls book now and she emphasises the importance of incorporating grass fed meat and wild fish etc in one â s daily diet â¦ so which is best follow ? meat or no meat ? dr. wahl â s diet as listed below , is incredibly nutrient dense * despite * the inclusion of animal foods.from my limited reading ( i have not read her book ) , she seems to emphasize omega-3s , which is perhaps why she is endorsing â grass-fed â meat or certain fish . why she doesn â t use plant-based sources for omega-3s is unclear . perhaps because she was already inclined towards eating a paleo diet ( during which she continued to decline ) before starting the vegetable-heavy nutrient dense regime described below ( as a result of which she improved ) . perhaps this paleo inclination has resulted in an aversion to flax or chia seeds , or perhaps she feels she requires long chain omega-3s , though she could of course consume this in the form of algae.i suspect that being off all grains and potatoes , she requires something calorically dense to simply survive and function , and has found that in low micronutrient but high calorie animal foods.in any case , with all of the veggies she eats per day , the room left for animal foods is scant . i can â t imagine her eating a large amount of animal foods on top of all of those veggies.so on one hand , we have multiple , highly reproducible studies showing a high plant food low saturated fat diet works for ms. on the other hand , we have an n = 1 anecdotal tale about someone who eats an obviously high plant food diet and has also corrected her ms. depending on the amount of animal foods she consumes , there may or may not be very much significant disagreement here . it would be interesting to know her saturated fat intake . perhaps it is lower than people are inferring from her dietary description , or perhaps it is higher than those on the swank diet , but her 9 cups of veggies per day are also higher than those on the swank diet , and are providing a therapeutic effect to mitigate the effect of the fats . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ dr. wahl â s diet : 3 cups of cruciferous and dark greens3 cups intensely coloured : 1 cup red vegetables / fruit , 1 cup blue black vegetables / fruits , 1 cup yellow / orange vegetable / fruits3 cups others including : 1 cup mushrooms / onion family ( for organic sulphur ) , and seaweed for iodine and trace minerals.include spices and herbs.omega 3 rich foods , green leaves and animals fed green leaves , wild fish and seafood . and you could add fish oil.eat organ meats once per weekregular bone brothfermented foods or a probioticb00mer : you hit the points i wanted to make , but you did so a lot more robustly and elegantly than i would have . i was going to compare to the â mediterranean diet â and quote ( to the best of my memory ) jeff novick : â were they healthy * because * of the olive oil or * inspite * of it ? â without clinical trials on dr. wahl â s diet , we have to use common sense to determine which parts ( or all ) of her diet were likely the cause of her personal , anecdotal success.thanks for your post.thanks thea . i had jeff novick â s quotation in my mind as well . funny how people love to pick out the single least significant and least healthful food out of an overall healthy diet to glorify e.g. olive oil or goat cheese with the mediterraneans , fish with the japanese , etc.i could only stand to watch about half of the video as it was achingly unscientific , but the word i heard a million times was micronutrients micronutrients micronutrients . what exactly does micronutrient intake have to do with eating meat ? nothing , unless you â re trying to minimize it.she also flippantly mentions â the essential fats are important too â , specifically mentioning saturated fat , which of course is nonessential . and in the same breath attempts to relate it to plasma membrane fluidity , which is inversely related to saturated fat composition.it is astounding that someone that displays ignorance about such extremely basic biochem and nutrition principles is given a platform to speak about diet and health . of course , if her message of micronutrients and essential fas is getting cleverly construed to = > eat meat and saturated fat and be healthy , well , i â m sure she â ll sell a lot of books.b00mer : you gave me my laugh for the day . : - ) thanks for that additional analysis / info . wow . wow . wow . reminds me of jon stewart â s responses to certain politicians and our media . painful , but it â s better to laugh than cry.dr. wahls â experience is not anecdotal or based on one person . she has been doing clinical trials on patients with her diet for the last year . and thousands of people are using her diet plan with amazing success . just visit her facebook page . the brain uses fat for fuel , not glucose . i like everything about this site except its obvious vegan fanaticism.ehm â¦ the first fuel for brain is glucose , and if there are problems with glucose supply then body starts to use ketones body from fat catabolism â¦ http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / human _ brain # metabolismif fat are really primary sources for the brain why does gluconeogenesis exists ? i found a review that could answer some question about the brain preference for glucose instead of atty acids : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23921897in another review the authors talk about the brain areas that regulate glucose homeostasis : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23913677or this text :

ei = rd73u8 _ rd-zo7aaylyhyba & ved = 0cceq6aewaa # v = onepage & q & f = falsei think it covers pretty much every brain metabolism â¦ of course it could be more difficult than that : http : / / www.nature.com / jcbfm / journal / v23 / n6 / abs / 9591414a.htmlto me , glucose is of primary importance , then cames the other substrates â¦ there are no articles linked to on her facebook page.on her personal website , she lists only three articles , * none * of which examine the role of fat in treatment of ms : â one article has no dietary intervention component whatsoever . â the other two articles examine up to five other physical , exercise , and lifestyle related interventions in conjuction with dietary interventions including up to 17 supplements and huge amounts of nutrient dense green and sulfur containing vegetables . again , there is no evidence presented to suggest that her patients are in fact consuming large amounts of saturated fat.compare these * two * multifactoral , small ( literally one was n = 1 ) , uncontrolled , short-term studies with the longest running , most successful study on ms in the history of medical literature , which * specifically studies * dietary saturated fat and its effect on ms.there is no comparison between the work of swank and wahls.if you or others purchase her books and see personal progress , that is interesting , but anecdotal.if she â s got a study in the works that she can 1 ) actually get published , that would 2 ) actually validate what she says about fat , then i â ll be interested to read it.but this website is based on modern science and what that means is peer reviewed literature , not anecdotes and hearsay . you could even say we â re fanatical about that . until dr. wahls actually publishes * any * literature showing that fat is beneficial for ms patients , there really isn â t any valid scientific conversation to be had about it.the articles she lists on her website study the following : 1. neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( nmes ) and physical therapy improves gait2. a case study of one woman using physical therapy , home exercise and stretching , nmes , and a diet of 600 grams of cruciferous vegetables , 300 grams of brightly colored fruits or vegetables , 60 to 100 grams of meat , poultry or fish , 4 supplements , and no milk , eggs , or gluten . the patient specifically mentions in her own words that it is when she fails to consume the cruciferous vegetables , she experiences a decline in energy and mental focus.3. the effect of stretching , strength exercise , meditation , massage , electrical stimulation , and a â modified paleolithic â diet ( specifically encouraging green and sulfur containing vegetables as well as 17 supplements ) on fatigue â in the author â s own words , it was a small , uncontrolled pilot study , and their only conclusions were that it improved fatigue and that people followed the plan relatively well.as far back as the 1980s when i was a practicing natural nutritionist , mds would recommend their patients see me for nutrition counseling , since dietitians were still interested in processed , packaged , â industrial strength â edibles . long story short : numerous ms patients regained health even to the point of getting off disability and going back to work . diet is the key biochemical factor in health and wellness , which allopathic medicine still cannot seem to accept since it is steeped in chemical medicine , i.e. , toxic pharmaceuticals , which , in many diseases , only exacerbates the problem . the human organism was designed to function with high quality nutrients found in plant-based and some animal foods , as humans have ingested since time immemorial . only within the last century have laboratory-made â mostly petrochemical-based â pharmaceuticals displaced healing foods and modalities . nutrition was called quackery in the 1980s by those in the medical profession who thought they knew it all . i can remember an md , who was head of a hospital , asking me , â don â t you think if there was something to nutrition , we â d know about it ? â dr. greger â s work is a breath of fresh air and i compliment him and his team to the highest . my only hope is that the medical profession in its entirety expand their collective consciousness so as to include natural nutrition â not food processing industry nutrition â in med schools and throughout ancillary medical professions.you are right , when i reversed ms by diet on few hundreds patients , i heard all stupid arguments from my colleagues , being the only md in a department of neurology who was not prescribing sleeping pills and having my patients sleeping well . when the tension was too intense i changed my clinical research subject from ms to vascular to explore the bbb and then i was granted american patent for a rescue blood pump i am launching now . i want to be back to nutrition and neurodegenerative disease because i have enough data to know that something is possible to be done with the younger generation . eating is the fuel of life , i do not get why so may people are blind about that.doctors believe that i have 2nd progressive ms. i have been eating as vegan for 6 months . are you saying that i should eat salmon twice a week ? the diet as preventive medicine is a life long diet . twice wild fish a week as cold water cod , herring , salmon , salmon roe once a week these with a organic vegetarian diet may help you to prevent ms to worsen , i described signs of lymphocytes 1 week before relapse , then the 2nd step was to give antioxydants when these signs started for 3 weeks , i observed relapses 2 weeks after the ending the antioxydant treatment . in progressive ms , it is a mixture of chronic inflammatory response , worsening of scares and reactivation of old lesion . i like turmeric and ginger as anti-inflammatory nutriments , most of my patients with progressive ms felt improved adding that to their diet , salmon with ginger green tea rice which is a simple recipe , very japanese looks helping . gaba rice of course.can you eat flax or hemp seeds instead of fish to stay vegan ? yes you can and have seaweeds salads and soups tooi like hemp seed but i have no scientific evaluation . i just use it for me when i am very busy , i had a serious chronic disease , my diet works better than prescription.i have taken your advice regarding turmeric , ginger , and last night i made the ginger green tea gaba rice with a small piece of wild alaskan salmon with the skin on . i have to admit ; i am already walking better , and will continue to have the salmon twice a week for a few months , and see how i do . i am a little concerned about pcb â s though . thank you ! there is nothing special in salmon and other fish that isn â t found in in a better form in plant foods . however , seafood contains iodine , which is deficient in land based foods due to modern intensive farming practices stripping the soil . the abundance of flourine and chlorine in the modern world also displaces iodine from the body , so we need much more of it today . iodine is essential for the production of a thyroid hormone that is involved in the methylation process , which in in turn creates the methylcobalamin needed to build the myelin sheaths , the fatty protective layer around nerves which break down in people with ms.you would have had better results from consuming kombu / kelp , and would have avoided the cholesterol and saturated fats in the fish . you would have even better results adding drops of lugol â s iodine into a smoothie while taking a methylselenocysteine supplement ( selenium is essential for displacing halogens bound into iodine receptors . also if you take iodine while selenium deficient it will exacerbate that deficiency and affect your thyroid ) .take an algal supplement for omega 3s ( which are superior to fish supplements ) and / or consume 7g of flax , 20g of hemp or 4 walnuts . also eat plenty of berries and leafy greens which are high in omega 3s while being low in all other fats.thanks fruitbat ; i am not especially thrilled about eating meat again . it â s just that i have been a strict vegan for the last six months , and have greatly enjoyed eating whole food , but i have continued to loose my ability to walk . thanks for your suggestions ; i have been doing most of them including taking selenium ( plus eating beans twice a week ) , except for the kelp , and iodine . i will try this and see if it makes a difference in my abilities . i have been eating ground flax seeds , walnuts and flax oil for the omega 3 â s , but was thinking that there might be something to eating the omega 3 â s from a real fatty fish whole food source . i do want to continue to walk.i am so happy to help and hope it works out for you ! the lugol â s comes in different strengths ( from 2-15 % ) and qualities , some contain sodium iodide instead of the superior potassium iodide for example . don â t be afraid of consuming too much â in japan the average iodine intake from sea vegetable consumption is 13 milligrams a day , over 86 times higher than the rda of 150 micrograms recommended in the western world . one twelfth of a teaspoon of 7 % lugol â s contains 12.5 milligrams of iodine . 12.5 to 50 milligrams is considered by doctors who have studied iodine therapy to be a useful dose . it is best to start at the lower level , and consume it in a fruit smoothie as it disguises the taste while providing magnesium , which works with iodine in the body.it is important that the form of selenium is usable â the inorganic form such as selenite can be toxic if too much is consumed , and are difficult for the body to utilise . a good supplement is life extension se-methyl l selenocysteine.regarding omega 3 fats in fish , you â d have to consume 215g or nearly a whole fillet of salmon every day to provide enough , which would also give you 118 mg of cholesterol . additionally , it would give you 1.5g of methionine â more than you need in a day in a single piece of food â dr greger has a video about excessive methionine feeding cancer cells.algal supplements naturally contain dha and epa in a good 2 : 1 ratio , are free of mercury , and have not been chemically deodorized to disguise the smell of rotting fish . if your fat intake is low enough , the body can produce epa and dha from omega 3 â s found in plant foods , but a supplement can â t hurt if you feel you need one.on a personal note , i started the 80 / 10 / 10 high calorie raw fruit and leaf based diet several months ago , and while there were some general improvements in my health and appearance , i was disappointed that i didn â t get the incredible benefits claimed by other people , particularly in regard to my adhd . it is so disheartening and frustrating to be making the effort to do everything right and not see results . iodine was the missing link for me â sea vegetables are ignored ( though not prohibited ) on the 80 / 10 / 10 so if a person is already iodine deficient ( which is common , especially in sufferers of adhd ) this diet will not help to rectify the problem and may even make it worse . the same is true of a general plant based diet , since livestock fodder is fortified with iodine so that animal products provide small amounts , and people on plants based diets generally do not consume sea vegetables to make up for and better it.good luck to you , hopefully this extra information was helpful , and i really hope that supplementing with iodine will prove beneficial in reversing your msi am happy iy is working for you , making it part of your routine may help you significantly . thank you to share it.i â d just like to point out that vegans have always existed . meat eaters are overly fond of saying that humans have always eaten meat . no other primate habitually eats flesh , the only animal products other primates eat are insects.as someone who has lived with relapsing / remitting ms for about 27 years , this kind of upcoming report is very exciting to me . i own dr. swank â s book and have tried to model my diet on his , although i â ve never been 100 % faithful to the diet . i did want to correct an impression you gave in the article that interferon beta and chemo drugs are the only treatment options for ms. i â ve been on copaxone since 2000 and have had only one relapse during that time.i think at this point the best science supports dr. swank â s approach . you can read more about this issue on john mcdougall â s website which includes an interview with dr. swank . given the nature of the disease it is difficult and expensive to do good studies due to the time frames needed . i would not recommend meats or saturated fats at this time . hopefully the study that was funded by dr. mcdougall â s foundation will lead to a larger longer study . i can â t think of any downsides to his approach . i do know that if you have one chronic disease you don â t want another such as arterial disease or diabetes or cancer . good luck.the best science seems to show there is no effect . the study already has been published : http : / / www.neurology.org / content / 82 / 10 _ supplement / p6.152.shortthe study was not expected to show efficacy given the small numbers of participants ( 30 ) and limited time frame ( 1 year ) when considered relative to the natural time frame of ms ( years ) . dr. bourdette is hoping that this study will open the door to a much larger and longer term study which would be needed to actually show efficacy . so the best science is yet to come . it will most likely be done in europe as most studies in this country are done to test the use of drugs or procedures . i heard dr. bourdette speak at the mcdougall advanced study weekend at the time the study was funded . the interesting side note is it took the ethics committee at oregon health and science center a while to decide that a study which put participants on the intervention diet was safe ! so for now as i mentioned in my previous post i would recommend this approach to anyone who might have or does have ms. i have one patient who was wheel chair bound who benefited with better control of his type 1 diabetes and his wife says his stool problems have greatly improved . thanks for taking the time to comment and post the article â¦ keep tuned to nf.org as the science keeps coming.the swank diet appears to include meat , eggs and dairy . it is not a vegan diet . to really benefit one needs to go vegan plus and eat a diet of whole organic plants while avoiding salt , sugar and refined carbohydrates. xyzmy sister has had ms for over 35 years . unfortunately , i do not think anybody shared the info generated by dr. swank â s research with her . we did not know it to share with her until the very recent years . she has been in a nursing home for about 13.5 years , unable to roll over in bed , or to move arms and legs . she is barely able to speak at this point , and has had stomach tube for liquid diet for years . she has been in hospice care for over a year . she is 63 years old . the disease has devastated her life.kathypoppyseed : re : â unfortunately , i do not think anybody shared the info generated by dr. swank â s research with her . â that â s just so criminal.this type of thing drives me * nuts . * dr. greger addresses this point yet again in his latest summary talk ( from table to able ) . our doctors and experts should be telling us what the science says . let us decide how we want to use that information . but they have no business patronizing us and hiding the information.ms is such a terrible disease , which your sister and you have first hand experience with . i â m sorry to hear about your situation.i switched over to a vegan diet recently and noticed an immediate improvement in terms of more energy and fat loss . i â m in medical school now and i believe that we will find out with more research that autoimmunity is the root cause of many seemingly unrelated diseases . my own theory is that the body gets confused by foreign animal proteins and mounts an autoimmune attack , and that the deleterious effects are only felt eventually over time . dr. greger has shown us countless studies on the benefits of a vegan diet . it really is a no-brainer at this point.what kind of food can i eat and could i get a recepie bookkags : i am not a doctor or expert and i do not know your situation . i can not make recommendations from either of those perspectives . however , i have purchased quite a few whole plant food based cookbooks over the last few years . i can recommend some books that based on my limited understanding would meet the needs of someone who is posting on this page.first , you might consider checking out dr. mcdougall â s book , the starch solution . the front part of the book contains some great info . and the back part contains some great recipes.while i just got , happy herbivore light and lean , i think it is going to be one of my favorite books . check it out ! if cost is an issue for you , check out vegan on the cheap ( and just don â t use oil for those recipes that call for it ) . for really simple recipes , check out vegan on $ 4 a day.if you have kids , check out let them eat vegan . ( or even if you don â t have kids , check it out . ) you might also want to check out some on-line resources , including pcrm â s site and the free 21 day kickstart program . they have a ton of free recipes that are healthy , tasty and easy to make.hope that helps.or appetite for reduction by isa chandra moshkowitzhttp : / / www.cpnhelp.org is an antibiotic protocol which has actually cured many many people.i feel like you are overpromising , dr. greger . my vegan friend with ms was vegan before her diagnosis ten years ago and has been vegan continuously for at least 3 decades . she is still crippled by her horrible ms symptoms.ms is as variable as humans are , to the extent that i call it â the charlatan â s wet dream â . whatever you pick , including nothing ( exercise , meditation , acupuncture , prayer , etc . ) , someone can point to it and say â this worked for me ! â . add biochemical individuality to spontaneous remission , the placebo effect , and confirmation bias , and stir in some charisma and scientific jargon , and you have a recipe for malady-based riches.she needs iodine . iodine . although being vegans doesn â t automatically mean one is eating a low saturated fat diet.read professor george jelinek â s book â overcoming multiple sclerosis â . he was diagnosed with ms in 1999 and due to his work as a professor of medicine , was in a position to access all the latest research about ms. his protocol is based on dr swank â s diet , vitamin d3 supplementation ( 5000iu daily ) , omega 3 as fish or flax oil daily , execise and meditation ( to alleviate stress ) . he has not had a relapse for about fourteen years . â recovering from ms â , also by jelinek , and law , is the stories of some of the people with ms who have used his protocol very successfully . he also has interviews on you tube.dr. greger , i â ll bring to your attention that mcdougall and yadav â s 1 year results have already been presented and published at 2014 american academy of neurology â s annual meeting . the results show no difference in presence of lesions , from mri scans . i refer you to : http : / / www.neurology.org / content / 82 / 10 _ supplement / p6.152 and http : / / www.healthline.com / health-news / low-fat-vegan-diet-may-ward-off-ms-fatigue-050614i do wish you would be equally vocal about studies that show no effect , at least as a reference to those who come to this page with high hopes.also bison is your alternative to beef . fish is also good for you . no beef , sugar or coffee . we are still working on the last 2 with my wifeit seems to me that there are two threads in this conversation , neither of which are recognizing the other . that can change , the recognition part , the conclusions do not need to change , necessarily . ok , on the one thread we have a description of doctor swank â s wor , which spans decades and has follow up results of both long and sort term duration . this thread also brings to the readers a recent controlled study initiated by dr. john mcdougall. the second thread is about the paleo diet and the results a physician got with that diet on her own case do multiple sclerosis . also sited is the commonality of large proportions of foods containing antioxidants . the book that woman wrote has been read by the participants in that thread . i have a sister who has had ms for 36 years . the last 13.5 years have been spent in a nursing home . the whole time she has been paralyzed , unable to move her arms or legs , unable to roll over , in bed without assistance . the last 5-7 years she has had a tube for feeding directly into her stomach , because she cannot swallow effectively . i could go on and on . she has been fed some variety of ensure , a liquid , which has kept her alive . she can also have snacks , of junk food , if someone feeds them to her , likeguess my reply was too long . i just want to concluded that i. do not think that my sister ever was told about dr. swank â s work . it is way too late for her now , but diet should be an integral , part of health care practices . ms is just one example of where that is so important . so people who understand that diet is so important ought to be getting on the same side in an effort to change established medical practices and establish food cultures . thanks , i have made my point poppyseedsomeone pointed out to me years ago that diet is the problem because in a lot of countries ms just don â t exist . i was very thankful for that infoa preliminary , not yet peer reviewed study released today reports no association between diet and ms. here is a link to a summary. http : / / www.medpagetoday.com / meetingcoverage / ectrims / 47667i find myself at a loss for what to believe . i suspect the study referenced above simply does not have enough participants following the actually food plan required to achieve the results we â d like to associate with a healthy vegan diet . anyone else feel like screaming ? oh , and note that in the study cited above , the only statistical correlation to reduced incidence of ms was high adherence to a western diet.yes , the authors have relationships with companies making ms products.she had amasing results . i don â t know if dr greger is aware of this ladyhttps : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = hlxxg49vzmui have 2 friends who have great results with their ms when they started taking juice plus + , and my own family has had amazing results as well ! can juice plus + help with multiple sclerosis ? though we cannot promise that juiceplus + will cure any illness or health condition , this is what i can say : ms is an autoimmune challenge that juice plus + can make a difference with , in time . it may take double the dosage , however , if the ms is severe.the immune study shows that b-cells become less hyperactive with juice plus + , i.e. make fewer antibodies against the body itself , which is the problem with all autoimmune disorders . autoimmune disorders show up in different ways in different people , manifesting symptoms based on our own unique genetic weaknesses.instead of focusing on the name of the disease , if we can go back to the cause of all autoimmune diseases â a trigger-happy immune system â then we do better . juice plus + makes the immune system less trigger-happy . â clean eating fitness junkie â http : / / www.facebook.com / jenpalbci invite you â¦ to watch this video that could change your health & the health of your family in numerous ways !

â â i â ve never seen someone recover so quickly ! â â your health is incredible ! â â you are cured ! â â¦ .on and on and on.anyway , i just feel really passionate about this product and decided to promote it , in hopes that others can experience the vast improvements in health like we have . it â s also great for those with diabetes , because you can get all of your fruits & vegetables without any of the sugar ! i love that juice plus + is not a supplement â¦ .it â s actual real food nutrition ! please let me know if you have any questions , or want more information . i would love to hear from you ! if you â d like to give juice plus + a try , please contact me or you can even go directly to my website and order from there.http : / / jennifer-palazzolo.juiceplus.com / content / juiceplus / en / what-is-juice-plus / what-is-juice-plus.html # .vebcypldxngone of the most compelling things about juice plus + is the fact that there have been over 30 research studies conducted in leading hospitals & universities around the world . the studies and results are available on my website : http : / / jennifer-palazzolo.juiceplus.com / content / juiceplus / en / clinical-research / clinical-research.htmlhave a great day ! jeni have ms since 2007 . my lifestyle and my nutrition were so bad but i had just one redicive i all my life , at the moment . when i ask the people who have ms as well , the people tell me almost the same , their lifestyle and nutrion are so f â¦ bad . i don Â´ t know if the vegetarian people have better life than people who eat meat but i think that we need some nutrients as vitamin b and we can Â´ t find in veggies â¦ we need vitamin d , we need omega 3 â¦ and normally the people who eat the meat don Â´ t have a good lifestyle ( because they meet trans-fat , drink sugar Â¨ liquid â as coca-cola , mcdonalds â¦ . ) and the vegetarian people are interesting more in their nutrition â¦ but i am totally sure â¦ we need a god meat ! dear dr. greger , thank you for this article . the mcdougall â s study on multiple sclerosis and diet has been published and no real difference was seen between the â diet â and â control â groups in mri images ; nor was a difference in disability or relapses seen between the diet intervention and control groups . what is your opinion ? thank you.seriously wondering would fresh meat from a deli cause relapses also ? it might . deli meat still has loads of saturated fat so if high animal fat is one of the culprits then limiting or avoiding meat ( deli meat ) may be considered. acute myeloid leukemia , africa , aging , angiogram , animal fat , animal products , asia , autoimmune diseases , beef , bladder disease , bladder health , brain disease , brain health , cardiovascular health , chemotherapy , chicken , cholesterol , cognition , dairy , dr. caldwell esselstyn , dr. dean ornish , dr. john mcdougall , dr. roy swank , eggs , europe , eye disease , eye health , fat , fatigue , heart disease , heart health , inflammation , ldl cholesterol , leukemia , low-fat diets , meat , medications , milk , mortality , multiple sclerosis , nerve health , norway , pain , plant-based diets , pork , poultry , pritikin , saturated fat , sausage , side effects , surgery , tremors , turkey , vegans , vegetarians , vision weakness - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-111: how to get kids to eat their vegetables what happens if we give one group of kids a plate of cookies and the other group the same number of cookies , but cut in half , and tell both groups they can eat as many as they want ? researchers reported that decreasing cookie size led to 25 % fewer cookie calories eaten . the goal of that study was to help counter obesity-promoting eating behaviors facilitated by the availability of large portions of junk food . the findings â suggest that reducing the size of cookies ( without altering the total amount of food ) decreases children â s short-term caloric intake , â a dietary strategy for parents to discreetly decrease unhealthy behaviors . but they were using sugar wafers â what â s in those things ? partially hydrogenated oil ( trans fats ) . what â s so bad about trans fats ? see trans fat in meat and dairy , trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero , and breast cancer survival and trans fat . no one should be eating those cookies . in fact , i can think of another â dietary strategy â to decrease kid â s intake â don â t give them any ! admittedly , this is easier said than done . even in the â granola crunchy â san francisco bay area , a proposed ban on junk food suggested by parents and school administrators sent a faction of teachers into an apoplectic fit . in texas , there was so much parental outrage that they got lawmakers to pass a safe cupcake amendment . the amendment , known as lauren â s law , ensures that parents and grandparents of schoolchildren celebrating a birthday can bring whatever they want to school . fine . what if we just offered fruit in addition to the cupcakes at classroom celebrations ? in a study outlined in my video , tricks to get kids to eat healthier at school , researchers provided bowls of fresh , cut-up fruit in addition to the party food brought by the parents at two of four kindergarten or preschool celebrations to observe student response . no special effort was made to encourage students to choose the fruit : they just put it out there . would kids actually eat fruit when there was birthday cake , ice cream , and cheese puffs taking up nearly a whopping third of their daily caloric intake ? yes ! on average each kid ate a full fruit serving . take that , cheesy puffs ! there are entire curricula available now for schools , such as â veggiecation , â where for a whole year classrooms feature a new â veggie of the month , â sprinkled with nutrition mantras like â fiber equals a happy tummy . â and they work ! â the active engagement of students in tasting and rating vegetable dishes seemed to have contributed to higher consumption of featured vegetables . â one school was able in some cases to double vegetable consumption just by giving them attractive names . elementary students ate twice the number of carrots if they were called â x-ray vision carrots , â compared to when they were just â carrots â or generically named â food of the day . â how about â power punch broccoli , silly dilly green beans , or tiny tasty tree tops ? â selection of broccoli increased by 109.4 % , and green beans by 177 % . conclusion : â these studies demonstrate that using an attractive name to describe a healthy food in a cafeteria is robustly effective , persistent , and scalable with little or no money or experience . these names were not carefully crafted , discussed in focus groups , and then pre-tested . â they just thought them up out of thin air . and kids were suckered into eating healthier for months by putting out silly little signs . in this school , vegetable intake was up nearly 100 % , while in the control school without signs , vegetable consumption started low and actually got worse . so why isn â t every single school in the country doing this right now ? ! bring it up at your next pta meeting . and if we want to get really bold , we can join the nutritious school lunch revolution led by pioneering organizations like the new york coalition for healthy school food ( check out their website at www.healthyschoolfood.org ) . whenever i find myself frustrated by half measures , i am forced to remind myself just how sad the standard american diet is . see nation â s diet in crisis for a reality check . one of the problems is that parents may not even realize there is a problem ( mothers overestimate dietary quality ) . for more healthy eating tricks check out : tricks to get kids to eat healthier at home and tricks to get adults to eat healthier . i â d be interested in contacting schools who had this veggiecation . anyone know of any schools ? hi june , check out their website and / or locate a veggiecator : http : / / www.veggiecation.com / dr greger i want you to be more straightforward . cutting food into smaller pieces , a dietary strategy for parents to decrease â unhealthy behaviors â is really taking advantage of more surface area to decrease â overeating â ! i think you must always describe what you mean when by â healthy â or â unhealthy â behavior . strategies to decrease calorie consumption or to limit overeating just sounds less judgmental and is easier for people to understand . dr greger your videos and blogs get better every day . thanksthe amendment , known as lauren â s law , ensures that parents and grandparents of schoolchildren celebrating a birthday can bring whatever they want to school. http : / / 0rz.tw / 9biiyread kids the mitch spinach children â s book series . learn how to get superpowers from eating fruits and veggies ! how about making the vegetables more tasty , not with sugar , but with cooking ?

            "Query PLAIN-132: can we fight the blues with greens ? why does frequent consumption of vegetables appear to cut one â s odds of depression by more than half ? and â frequent â was defined as eating vegetables not 3 or more times a day , but just 3 or more times a week . a 2012 study was found that eliminating animal products improved mood within two weeks . the researchers blamed arachidonic acid , found primarily in chicken and eggs , which might adversely impact mental health via a cascade of brain inflammation . more on this inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid in : but better moods on plant-based diets could also be from the good stuff in plants â a class of phytonutrients that cross the blood brain barrier into our heads . a recent review in the journal , nutritional neuroscience , suggests that eating lots of fruits and vegetables â may present a noninvasive natural and inexpensive therapeutic means to support a healthy brain . â but how ? to understand the latest research , we need to understand the underlying biology of depression â the so-called monoamine theory of depression . it â s the idea that depression may arise out of a chemical imbalance in the brain . in my video fighting the blues with greens ? i run through an oversimplified version . one of the ways the billions of nerves in our brain communicate with one another is through chemical signals called neurotransmitters . two nerve cells don â t actually touch â there â s a physical gap between them . to bridge that gap , when one nerve wants to tap the other on the shoulder it releases chemicals into that gap , including three monoamines : serotonin , dopamine and norepinephrine . these neurotransmitters then float over to the other nerve to get its attention . the first nerve then sucks them back in to be reused the next time it wants to talk . it â s also constantly manufacturing more monoamines , and an enzyme , monoamine oxidase , is constantly chewing them up to maintain just the right amount . the way cocaine works is by acting as a monoamine re-uptake inhibitor . it blocks the first nerve from sucking back up these three chemicals and so there â s a constant tapping on the shoulder â constant signaling â to the next cell . amphetamines work in the same way but also increase the release of monoamines . ecstasy works like speed , but just causes comparatively more serotonin release . after awhile , the next nerve may say â enough already ! â and down-regulate its receptors to turn down the volume . it puts in earplugs . so we need more and more of the drug to get the same effect , and then when we â re not on the drug we may feel crappy because normal volume transmission just isn â t getting through . antidepressants are thought to work along similar mechanisms . people who are depressed appear to have elevated levels of monoamine oxidase in their brain . that â s the enzyme that breaks down those neurotransmitters . in the video mentioned previously , i show the levels of monoamine oxidase in the brains of depressed individuals versus healthy individuals . if the levels of our neurotransmitter-eating enzyme is elevated , then our levels of neurotransmitters drops , and we become depressed ( or so the theory goes ) . so a number of different classes of drugs have been developed . the tricyclic antidepressants , named because they have three rings like a tricycle , appear to block norepinephrine and dopamine re-uptake , and so even though our enzymes may be eating these up at an accelerated rate , what gets released sticks around longer . then there were the ssris ( the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) like prozac . now we know what that means â they just block the re-uptake of serotonin . then there are drugs that just block the re-uptake of norepinephrine , or block dopamine re-uptake , or a combination . but if the problem is too high levels of monoamine oxidase , why not just block the enzyme ? make a monoamine oxidase inhibitor . they did , but monoamine oxidase inhibitors are considered drugs of last resort because of serious side effects â not the least of which is the dreaded â cheese effect , â where eating certain foods while on the drug can have potentially fatal consequences . if only there was a way to dampen the activity of this enzyme without the whole bleed-into-our-brain-and-die thing . now we can finally talk about the latest theory as to why fruits and vegetables may improve our mood . there are inhibitors of the depression-associated enzyme in various plants . there are phytonutrients in spices , such as clove , oregano , cinnamon , and nutmeg , that inhibit monoamine oxidase , but people don â t eat enough spices to get enough into the brain . a certain dark green leafy has a lot , but its name is tobacco , which may actually be one of the reasons cigarettes make smokers feel so good . ok , but what if we don â t want brain bleeds or lung cancer ? well , there is a phytonutrient found in apples , berries , grapes , kale , onions , and green tea that may indeed affect our brain biology enough to improve our mood , which may help explain why those eating plant-based diets tend to have superior mental health . for other natural treatments for mental illness , check out : this is fascinating . once again a one minute eduction improves my resolves to eat the right things ( plants ) and eschew the wrong things ( animals ) . thank you ! i live in seattle so there â s a constant fight with weather-related mood issues to add to whatever you bring . the lowering or stopping of meat eating does seem to make mood less solidly grey . i am wondering if some of it is chemistry ( you need lots of acid to digest it ) . and possibly some is also blood flow reduction ( the saturated fat ) . there can be good effects on mood from taking nitric oxide supplements such as arginine-citrulline formulas , and neo40 lozenges . i â m over 40 so have to take both of these to get an effect . but comparing these supplements to antidepressants , these supplements affected a larger area of energy in the body than just the brain â they pour the life back into everything , it seems to me . so if you examine spinach and beets , two outstanding sources of nitrates , there â s strong direct chemical creation of nitric oxide from plant-derived nitrates . nitrates become nitrites from action of bacteria in saliva , then pass on to the acidic stomach and become nitric oxide right there . but nitrates also are recycled from gut back to the saliva in an endless loop . this is the backup mechanism for older people whose arterial linings are shot and can â t make nitric oxide from arginine as would younger people . the use of both arginine and sodium nitrite supplements like neo40 ( neogenis.com ) effectively raises my nitric oxide levels to a good high target range in just a day or two , with great effect on mood and energy levels . it â s really quite amazing . but â¦ i also include beets and greens in fairly steady amounts through the week , higher than the average american by far would probably eat . i juice them and blend them , etc . the turmeric supplement can elevate mood for me , also , but not provide much energy release in the body . it â s got some benefits so i add that too ! : ) kaniwaplease post info about kaniwa or chenopodium pallidicaule , this was featured on dr. oz . how much phytates does it have ? thanks . : ) thanks for the info.this could explain why the atkins-people are so grumpy â¦ .. : - ) what about these findings : â vegetarians displayed elevated prevalence rates for depressive disorders , anxiety disorders and somatoform disorders . due to the matching procedure , the findings cannot be explained by socio-demographic characteristics of vegetarians ( e.g. higher rates of females , predominant residency in urban areas , high proportion of singles ) . the analysis of the respective ages at adoption of a vegetarian diet and onset of a mental disorder showed that the adoption of the vegetarian diet tends to follow the onset of mental disorders . conclusion : vegetarian diet is associated with an elevated risk of mental disorders â .http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22676203 â there was no evidence for a causal role of vegetarian diet in the etiology of mental disorders . â the community sample does not represent the population. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ?

            "Query PLAIN-142: dealing with air travel radiation exposure doctors appear to be causing tens of thousands of cancers with ct scans and dentists may be causing a few brain tumors with dental x-rays ( see my two videos cancer risk from ct scan radiation and do dental x-rays cause brain tumors ? ) , but what about these new-fangled airport full-body scanners that use so-called backscatter technology to reduce x-ray exposure ? a thousand times less radiation exposure than a chest x-ray , though they â re still being phased out . in fact , flight passengers may get 100 times more radiation during the flight every hour , because they â re so high up in the atmosphere and exposed to more cosmic rays . does that mean a round-trip cross-country flight is almost like getting a chest x-ray ? yes . anyone who â s seen my speaking schedule knows i â m totally screwed . but what can you do ? as is the answer to so many health questions , you can eat healthily . high dietary antioxidant intakes are associated with decreased dna damage in airline pilots . note the word â dietary . â antioxidant supplements didn â t work . no benefit was found for those taking multivitamins , vitamin c pills , or vitamin e pills . but those getting the most vitamin c from food , b carotene from food , cryptoxanthin from food , and lutein / zeaxanthin from food , saw a significant decrease in dna damage . the usda keeps a nice list of phytonutrient resources . cryptoxanthin sources listed here ( healthy pumpkin pie anyone ? ) . lutein and zeaxanthin can help us prevent glaucoma and see 27 miles farther and may present a dietary prevention of age-related macular degeneration . are these eyesight-saving phytonutrients also found in eggs ? you might be surprised . see egg industry blind spot . for more on why produce is generally preferable to pills , check out : these are all phytonutrients , of course , so when they say food , they really mean plants . and because antioxidants can have synergistic effects , the greatest protection was found when they were eating a combination of phytonutrients , so the greatest protection was found in those eating the citrus and broccoli and nuts and seeds and pumpkins and peppers and dark green leafy vegetables . though if one had to pick , greens may be the best . all this time i â ve been packing kale chips on planes as a snack just because they â re so lightweight , but now i know their dual purpose . the researchers conclude that a diet consisting of a variety of fruits and vegetables provides a natural source of these antioxidants as well as other potential protective factors , which may offer the best protection against cumulative dna damage associated with ionizing radiation exposure . the results are especially relevant to flight crews , astronauts , and frequent flyers . the same thing was found following hiroshima and nagasaki atomic bomb survivors for decades . models based on the available data suggest that the cancer risk in exposed persons may have been knocked down by daily green and yellow vegetable consumption from about 50 % increased cancer risk to only about 30 % increased risk . similar results were found for fruit consumption . so fruit and vegetable consumption can diminish , but not eliminate the risks of radiation . same thing was found following children after chernobyl . i profile a study in my video mediating radiation exposure from airline travel in which consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits was found to afford protection to the immune systems of exposed children , whereas egg and fish consumption was associated with significantly increased risk of chromosome damage within their bodies . researchers were unsure whether the damage attributed to fish and eggs was because the eggs and fish carried radioactivity , or whether it was just from the animal fat intake alone . why might eggs be harmful even if not radioactive ? see who says eggs aren â t healthy or safe ? or my other 58 videos on eggs . i cover natural and artificial radioactivity in fish in fukushima and radioactivity in seafood and explore concerns about other pollutants in my 89 fish videos . does food absorb radiation up that high in the sky ? in-flight eating maybe not good idea ? â¦ .. maybe prior to flight , post flight eating only ? the type of radiation we â re exposed to in an airplane is not radioactive particles that things absorb , it â s electromagnetic waves , aka radiation . so , sure , the food gets hit by radiation , and sure , that radiation can cause â damage â to the cells in the food . but the food isn â t contaminated with radiation , it â s merely been hit by it . only by hanging around fission reactions can actual radioactive particles be absorbed.seems to me that we should not be bringing any food ( kale chips included ) onto the plane . same goes with supplements . if our bodies absorb radiation , why would these â small little bodies â of food . and then we eat â this â food ? does seem prudent . i â m going to indulge in antioxidant rich foods pre-flight and when i land . same might go for water.the type of radiation we â re exposed to in an airplane is not radioactive particles that things absorb , it â s electromagnetic waves , aka radiation . so , sure , the food gets hit by radiation , and sure , that radiation can cause â damage â to the cells in the food . but the food isn â t contaminated with radiation , it â s merely been hit by it . only by hanging around fission reactions can actual radioactive particles be absorbeddr g good idea on kale chips â¦ i think ? i just looked in whole foods and the only brand i could find , name starts with a â r â , is about 40 % fat . what brand did you select ? where did you buy ? thanksyou should just make your own : - ) . it â s pretty easy if you have an oven or dehydrator . tastes better too.i too am concerned about bringing food onto a plane . it does make sense that if the human body absorbs radiation , then the avocado , the baby food , the breast milk , â¦ .all the goodies i bring with me up in the air â¦ .. all this stuff absorbs the radiation as well . makes me think the first things i should do when the plane lands is throw it all in the trash.interesting ! has anyone done a study on pilots and stewards / stewardess and their risk of cancer ?

            "Query PLAIN-152: how probiotics affect mental health before thorazine was invented in 1950 , mental illness was often treated surgically . in fact , in 1949 the inventor of the lobotomy was awarded the nobel prize . before tens of thousands were lobotomized , however , colectomy was all the rage . there was a theory that bad bacteria in the gut Â­ was the cause of mental illness . so the cure was to surgically remove the colon . yes , the surgery killed about one in three â but when they didn â t die , surgeons claimed positive results . some , for example , bragged that when they resected the colons of schoolchildren as a preventive measure there was a cessation of â abnormal sex practices â like masturbation ( which was viewed at the time as a precursor for mental illness later in life ) . reminds me of the mastectomies they used to perform for menstrual breast pain ( plant-based diets for breast pain ) . others , though , suggested a less drastic approach , proposing that one could instead treat this â intestinal putrefaction â by changing the intestinal flora . indeed , over a century ago there were reports of successfully treating psychiatric illnesses like depression with a dietary regimen that included probiotics . doctors perceived a connection between depression and â feces deficient in quantity and moisture and very offensive in odor . â reportedly , after the probiotic regimen not only did people feel better psychologically , but they had their â feces increase in quantity , become softer , and of regular consistency , and the offensive smell diminish â¦ . â concurrent with the probiotics , however , all patients were started on a vegetarian diet â so it may not have been the probiotics at all . why might the vegetarian diet alone have improved mood ? check out my videos plant-based diet & mood and the follow-up improving mood through diet as well as my serotonin series starting with human neurotransmitters in plants . this entire field of inquiry remained dormant for about a hundred years , but a new discipline has recently emerged known as enteric ( meaning intestinal ) neuroscience . our enteric nervous system â the collection of nerves in our gut â has been referred to as a â second brain â given its size , complexity , and similarity . we have as many nerves in our gut as we do in our spinal cord ! the size and complexity of our gut brain is not surprising when considering the challenges posed by the interface . we have a hundred times more contact with the outside world through our gut than through our skin . we also have to deal with our 100 trillion little friends down there . that takes a lot of processing power . anyone who â s had butterflies in their stomach knows that our mental state can affect our gut . studies show that every day stresses can actually affect gut flora populations . an innovative study out of australia looked at feces scraped from toilet paper used by undergrads during exam week . if you check out my 5-min video gut feelings : probiotics and mental health , you can see how many bacteria the undergrads had in their feces before and after the exam . you â ll notice the effect lasted the whole week . their findings show that our mental state can indeed affect our gut , but can our gut affect our mental state ? we didn â t know until recently . many suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome complain of gut dysfunction , so researchers tried giving sufferers probiotics to see if their mental and emotional state could be improved and it did appear to help . you can learn more about treating chronic fatigue syndrome in : what about for healthy people , though ? a study entitled â assessment of the psychotropic properties of probiotics â marked a turning point in our thinking . researchers found that one month of probiotics appeared to significantly decrease symptoms of anxiety , depression , anger and hostility . until that study was published , the idea that probiotic bacteria administered to the intestine could influence the brain seemed almost surreal â like science-fiction . well , science yes , but maybe not fiction . might people suffering from certain forms of mental health problems benefit from a fecal transplant from someone with more happy-go-lucky bacteria ? we don â t know , but this apparent ability of probiotics to affect brain processes is one of the most exciting recent developments in probiotic research . gut feelings : probiotics and mental health closes out my 4-part video series on the latest in probiotic science . i started with the two most established indications for their use in preventing and treating diarrhea with probiotics , then moved onto a more speculative use in preventing the common cold with probiotics ? , and then offered practical advice on how to best take probiotic supplements in should probiotics be taken before , during , or after meals ? what else might our good bacteria be doing for us ? they may help with weight control ( fawning over flora and gut flora & obesity ) and serve up anti-cancer compounds ! ( flax and fecal flora and sometimes the enzyme myth is true ) . is it possible that certain plant-based foods are causing certain mental health issues ? dr. greger , your good friend dr. mcdougall claims on his website that dairy and gluten-grains have been found to cause schizophrenia . he states this very clearly.could these gluten-grains be altering the gastrointestinal tract , compromising the integrity of the proper bacteria â¦ .. thus allowing the problem in the first place ? my mental health changed for the better when i eliminated 100 percent of gluten grains , dairy , and eggs â¦ with grains ( in all forms , actually ) being the worst offender . â¦ .getting rid of red meat , poultry , and most fish helped as well . a simple diet of raw and cooked vegetables , raw fruit , raw nuts , some beans , occasional shellfish â¦ .. has changed things for the better.do you have a vegan probiotic that you recommend ? jjv2 : lots of people swear by water kafir . you can read about it on-line , buy the crystals and grow it yourself . if taken care of , it lasts indefinitely . i can â t attest to its effectiveness myself . but it sounds better than anything else out there that i have seen.another option is rejuvalac . i have made rejuvalac myself several times . it â s not all that tasty by itself , but it makes great nut cheese . and i understand that it is also a natural probiotic . just something else for you to consider / research.good luck.dr. greger â wondering if you have any research supporting the use of probiotics to help children with spectrum disorders ? http : / / www.nytimes.com / 2015 / 06 / 28 / magazine / can-the-bacteria-in-your-gut-explain-your-mood.html ? action = click & contentcollection = opinion & module = mostemailed & version = full & region = marginalia & src = me & pgtype = article has more details of current research. anger , anxiety , bacteria , bowel movements , colectomy , colon , constipation , depression , emotional health , enteric nervous system , enteric neuroscience , fecal transplant , fibromyalgia , gut dysfunction , gut flora , intestinal flora , intestinal putrefaction , lobotomy , mastectomy , mental health , mental illness , mood , plant-based diet , probiotics , psychiatric illness , thorazine , vegan , vegetarian - -\n",

i have done videos about studies that make the headlines , but i think my most important role is to showcase studies that would otherwise never see the light of day . the reason we don â t see ads on tv for broccoli is the same reason we don â t hear about the vast majority of published research â there â s no profit motive . it may not make anyone money , but what if our lives would profit ? nutritionfacts.org was set up as a grand experiment . can a nutrition website remain independent and not bow to pressure to accept ad revenue or product endorsements or sell some dr. greger â s brand snakeoilwondersupplement ?

            "Query PLAIN-174: cinnamon for diabetes the use of cinnamon to help treat diabetes remains controversial . we know that cinnamon is so good at controlling one â s blood sugar that you can cheat on a diabetes test by consuming two teaspoons of cinnamon the night before your glucose tolerance test . that â s where they make you drink some sugar water to see how well your body can keep your blood sugar levels under control , and if you eat those two teaspoons right when the test starts or 12 hours before you can significantly blunt the spike . even a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference . a review of the best studies done to date found that the intake of cinnamon by type 2 diabetics or prediabetics does lower their blood glucose significantly . so what â s the controversy ? well , as i described in my video the safer cinnamon , cassia cinnamon , also known as chinese cinnamon ( probably what you â re getting at the store if it just says â cinnamon â ) contains a compound called coumarin which may be toxic to the liver at high doses . originally the concern was mainly for kids during christmas-time where they might get an above average exposure , but more recently some researchers suggest that kids just sprinkling some cassia cinnamon on their oatmeal a few times a week might exceed the recommended safety limit . as you can see in my 5-min video update on cinnamon for blood sugar control just a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon a few times a week may be too much for little kids , and if they â re eating that cinnamon-sprinkled oatmeal more like every day they can bump up against the limit for adults . so a teaspoon a day of cassia cinnamon might be too much for anyone , but can â t we just switch from cassia cinnamon to ceylon cinnamon and get the benefits without the potential risks ? without the risks , yes , but we â re no longer so sure about the benefits . nearly all of the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been done on cassia . we â ve just assumed that the same would apply for the safer cinnamon , ceylon , but only recently was it put to the test . that nice blunting of blood sugars we saw in response to cassia cinnamon disappeared when the researchers tried ceylon cinnamon instead . in fact , it may actually be the potentially toxic coumarin that was the active ingredient in the cassia cinnamon all along . thus , sidestepping the toxin by switching may sidestep the benefit . so should we just give up on going out of our way to add cinnamon to our diet ? no , i think it â s still a good idea to shoot for a teaspoon a day of ceylon cinnamon since there are a bunch of other benefits linked to cinnamon besides blood sugar control , not the least of which is it â s potent antioxidant content ( as i show in my one of my favorite videos antioxidants in a pinch ) . in my superfood bargains video , where i rank foods in terms of antioxidants per unit cost , cinnamon comes out as one of the cheapest food sources of antioxidants , beating out cloves and coming in just under purple cabbage . what about the oxalates in cinnamon ? not a problem , but the oxalates in too much turmeric may be a concern . as you â re making a healthy pumpkin pie with all that cinnamon , don â t accidentally add too much nutmeg , though , the subject of my follow-up video don â t eat too much nutmeg . ultimately cinnamon can no longer be considered a safe and effective treatment for diabetes . either you â re using cassia cinnamon , and it â s effective , but may not be safe , or you â re using ceylon cinnamon , which is safe , but does not appear effective . note that even the cassia cinnamon only brought down blood sugars modestly ( in other words , only as good as the leading diabetes drug in the world , metformin , sold as glucophage ) . so yes , it may work as good as the leading drug , but that â s not saying much . the best way to treat diabetes is to attempt to cure it completely , reversing diabetes with a healthy diet . books i would recommend ( in order of publication ) are defeating diabetes , dr. neal barnard â s program for reversing diabetes , and the end of diabetes . i talk more about the potential potency of plants in general in power plants and more about spices in particular in videos such as : amla versus diabetes explores the use of indian gooseberries as a way to help control blood sugar , though , again , the best way to deal with diabetes is to prevent and treat it with a healthy diet . nice article doc . reminds me of other natural elements like arsenic that are toxic or therapudic depending on dosagedear doctor g. love you dude , don â t ever stop . one suggestion , please label your postings , like this one , as re-post ( unchanged ) , revised ( updated ) , or new . this way i will know that i â m not having a seizure ( deja vu ) , but rather just reading something important , again.it seems like he may be intentionally trying to have each â blog â as a video and as an article . i think it â s nice to reiterate some older points.i understand that cinnamon can cause your platelet count to go down . if you have a low platelet count , this could be dangerous.thank you for this life-transforming and energizing site , dr. gregger ! our friends and we use cost co â s saigon cinnamon and cannot find any called ceylon . any new tests to see if saigon is ok ? any tips for online or marin county ca sources ? hey gayle , if you would like to purchase locally , whole foods sells organic ceylon ( a.k.a. â true â or sweet ) cinnamon for $ 22.99-24.99 / lb in the bulk section where all the herbs and spices are located . if you would like to purchase online , vitacost , mountainroseherbs , and amazon may be a few options to check out.thank you , minh ! i had been told whole foods did not have ceylon ! i should have looked to verify . thank you for your help ! hi dr greger , do you have a way to donate directly through paypal without logging into google ? the donation setup makes me a little nervous.hey phil , click â donate â at the top of the nutritionfacts.org homepage . then , click where it says â click here â under the donations & tax receipts on the right side . from this webpage , you have the choice of either logging into your paypal account or using a credit card to donate ( at the bottom left where it says â don â t have a paypal account ? â ) . hope this helps ! going vegan a year ago got rid of my diabetes , so i know your massage is correct , thanks for all your hard work.i have seen studies saying that it is only the cassia that has the blood sugar lowering ability and not the other ! exactly ! but cassia is the one that is harmful . cons outweigh the pros for cassia. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / update-on-cinnamon-for-blood-sugar-control / please note that coumarin , the toxic component in cassia cinnamon , is oil soluable . simply preparing cassia cinnamon as a tea ( hot water infusion ) will leave the bad stuff behind , and preserve the benefits . just use a mini-coffe maker , with a non-bleached paper filter , put a teaspoon of cassia right in the filter section , and enjoy . sometimes simple solutions ( pun ! ) can be best.good article . i like the angle of the discussion focusing on the two kinds of cinnamon which is seldom discussed in other posts antioxidants , blood sugar , cassia cinnamon , ceylon cinnamon , children â s health , chinese cinnamon , cinnamon , coumarin , diabetes , glucophage , glucose tolerance , indian gooseberries , liver , liver disease , liver health , metformin , nutmeg , oxalates , plant-based diet , toxins , vegan , vegetarian , youth health - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-195: why are children starting puberty earlier ? early onset of puberty is considered a risk factor for a number of diseases in adulthood , including hormone-related cancers , a shorter lifespan , metabolic syndrome , and cardiovascular disease . the conventional thinking has been that the age of puberty has been getting earlier and earlier because our children have been getting fatter and fatter . however , european kids are also getting heavier , yet there has not been a steady decline in puberty onset ( see graphs here ) . so it may be less about how much kids are eating and more about what they â re eating . the most consistent link between diet and premature puberty has been found to be animal protein consumption . every gram of daily animal protein intake â that â s just like the weight of a paperclip â has been associated with a 17 % increase in the risk of girls starting their periods earlier than age 12 . why this link between animal protein and premature puberty ? we know meat increases the level of igf-1 and that alone is associated with early onset puberty . if you â re not familiar with insulin-like growth factor 1 , i have a series of videos about the growth hormone ( though mostly in relation to cancer risk ) . see , for example , the answer to the pritikin puzzle and cancer-proofing mutation . the early onset of puberty in girls associated with animal protein consumption may also be due to endocrine disrupting chemical pollutants in the meat supply . watch my 4-min video protein , puberty , and pollutants . for more videos on premature puberty see : i talk more about endocrine disrupting chemicals in particular in : it is said that besides the above mentioned consequences of early onset of puberty another big problem would be that maids won â t grow in length more than one more year after menarche . afterwards they wouldn â t grow any more . if this happens when being for instance only 11 years old , it could lead to a pretty short body length . is there any science behind this ? i â d regard this point as very important as maids soon become women and if they will have health problems in the distant future it is bad indeed , but if they don â t even enjoy a happy life until they get sick it is even worse â their love life and happiness would be affected.yes it is true that menarche permanently stunts the growth. which one of the worst reasons why artificially early menarche is so bad.at the time of the revolutionary war , the average of menarche ( when a girl gets her first period ) was about 17 . around the 1900 â s , in america , the average age was about 14 to 15 . currently it is about 11-14 , but girls as young as 9 can get their periods now . moreover , we are seeing signs of the start of puberty â¦ .hair under the arms , pubic hair , etc in girls as young as 6 . it is due to the increased saturated fat in their diet . the more periods a girl has in her lifetime , the higher her risk of breast , uterine , and ovarian cancer . plus , early menarche robs girls of their childhood.i am now 72 , but my peers and i entered puberty at age 11 . today , many physicians are seeing signs of puberty in little girls age 3 and 4.there is zero evidence to support this . in fact , there is no evidence to support that saturated fat is harmful at all . the biggest heart study in the world found saturated fat and cholesterol to be protective ! there is however , substantial evidence that all the soy , growth hormones and xenoestrogens in everything all around us are huge factors in our health . i â d start there.actually , i agree with padma , being another person that actually works with patients , i have helped deliver babies from 12 yr olds . we are seeing children as young as 8 yrs old in puberty. this was not common in the 70 â s when i began practice . and btw , there is no legitimate study i have ever seen that says saturated fat is protective , it is eb knowledge that saturated fat is very inflammatory and destructive to the inner lining of our arteries , that includes brain , heart , kidneys â¦ i don â t think either saturated fat or soy are the problem . there are societies that eat tons of saturated fat ( mongolians , turkish herding peoples , the arctic peoples , herding peoples in africa , and traditionally some native americans ) who never had early puberty problems . on the other side of the coin , you have chinese , japanese , korean , and other east asian peoples who ate a ton of soy and rarely consumed animal protein ( they called soy â the meat without a bone â ) and they also did not have problems with early puberty. what is causing early puberty is the massive influx of petrochemicals into everyday life of so many , from the food made out of oil ( the fertilizer and pesticide both being made out of oil , you are literally eating oil when you eat these plants ) to the buildings made out of oil ( vinyl and polyester carpet floors , plastic counter tops , vinyl chair seats , mattresses stuffed with polyfill and saturated in fire retardants ) cars made out of oil ( the dash , seats , etc all made from oil ) and running on oil , the same at school and home , and eating out of plastic and cans that have xenoestrogenic effects on the health. oil is not good for us and every oil-based product has a xenoestrogenic response in the body and unfortunately our entire lifestyles are saturated with petroleum now , from our food to our environments , the clothes on our back , the soap , food containers , building materials , etc its all oil based unless you make a concerted effort to avoid itwouldn â t all the hormones they feed cows have something to do with it ? if you are consuming dairy products that have had added female and male hormones that would be a contributing factor . however , most of the female hormones in milk are there naturally due to the pregnancy . most of today â s â improved â dairy cows are kept pregnant over 300 days of the year . so they are usually milked while pregnant . pregnancy is a very high estrogenic state . dr. garvey would be more qualified as a gynecologist to comment further . being nursed and pregnant at the same time is not a prescription for long and productive life . most dairy cows are sent off to slaughter after only about 4 years . of course they live longer then the male dairy cows who are diverted to veal production and live for about 6 months before slaughter.not all cows receive rbgh , remember , recombinant bovine growth hormone which was injecting into cows to force them to give more milk . this was implicated early on during the 1990 â s . and came onto the market with michael taylor , now food czar for the u.s. fda , but in the 1980 â s , a lobbyist with monsanto worked to get it widespread into dairy.this was the reason i began buying certified organic organic valley and stonybrook farms dairy milks and yogurt , and i was not alone.however , now with an injured spine , my calcium comes from beans , certain fruits , and mostly dark leafy greens . they don â t make my body hurt the way dairy did.the average menarche of the maasai is almost 14 years. considering their diets are almost entirely animal foods [ high protein and high saturated fat ] shouldnt their menache be somewhere around age â¦ 4 ? i couldn â t find any references on age of menarche for the maasai but assuming 14 is accurate there are many reasons why it should be higher then folks on the standard american diet but not as high as those on a wfpd . the two that come to my mind are activity and calorie intake based on food availability . photo â s of the maasai show them to be very lean . since fat cells produce estrogen women who have higher per cent of body fat will have higher estrogen levels . as jeff novick points out so well in his calorie density dvd you can eat higher calorie dense foods if your physical activity level is high enough . like any complex system there are many factors contributing to the outcome.the massai consume about 3500 calories per day and though â active â in the sense that they walk a lot , they aren â t as active as american athletes . the massai are lean while eating crazy levels of saturated fat.this article sadly conflates modern , industrially produced , hormone-laden animal foods with all animal foods . it â s not like humans haven â t been eating meat , dairy , fish and eggs for , oh , thousands and thousands of years now . mongolians , maasai , and other heavy meat eaters don â t have early puberty , so this theory , without qualification , is bunk.and the author hasn â t even factored in the fact that almost everything processed contains some form of soy now â a known source of phytoestrogens . nor considered all the industrial chemicals used in the u.s. in everything from furniture to clothing that are known xenoestrogens ! we can â t just lay it all on animal protein , it doesn â t make good sense or science.it is totally possible to get wholesome meat , dairy , fish and eggs that haven â t been tainted by industrial chemicals , hormones and soy additives . just ask your local family farmer.ignoring the fact that you did not cite any evidence for your claims , the issues primarily discussed here do not have too much to do with contamination . the most convincing evidence to cut out animal products is ubiquitous among factory farmed meats and organic grass fed meats . that issue being endotoxemia and elevated igf-1. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / endotoxemia / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / igf-1 / in addition , human evidence shows that soy phytoestregons do not function like xenoestrogens and are beneficial to ones health and negligible in terms of negatively effecting hormonal balances . this remains true as long as one is below the 3-5 serving per day mark . after this point , one can expect raised igf-1 levels which in turn may affect early onset of puberty in children and promote tumor growth . this is true due to its protein quality , not necessarily the phytoestrogens. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / dairy-sexual-precocity / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / breast-cancer-survival-and-soy / in addition , poultry is a highly concentrated source of arachidonic acid which is highly inflammatory. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid / meat eating is only in recent human history , there are only scant findings before a few hundred years ago . not too many humans can run down a deer or even a rabbit , the muscles in our legs are not designed to do such a thing , but our hands are perfectly designed to grab those apples off a tree , or our teeth to chew on a handful of grass seeds . our intestines , gastric juices , pancreatic enzymes , and bacterial flora are perfect to digest fiber in plants and fruits , not decayed meat . only a carnivore can eat an animal carcass that has sat in the sun for a week , guess what would happen to you ! another possibility is that the europeans are getting a smaller dose of the super-estrogen steroid bisphenol a ( bpa ) .it certainly could be a contributory factor along with many others . since it has been introduced into the food chain relatively recently compared to the declining rates of puberty it most likely isn â t a major one . that said i advise patients to avoid it applying the precautionary principle.i don â t know how widespread but bpa has been in use since the 1950s http : / / www.enhs.umn.edu / current / 2008studentwebsites / pubh6101 / bpa / history.htmli did not see this early puberty in vegan children , mostly overweight flesheating children . everyone was exposed to bpa without realizing it back then , even the veggie kids . 30 yrs ago when i worked at a city hospital we were helping pregnant 12-13 yr olds deliver babies . in mho , believing meat is ok to feed young girls is living in a fool â s paradise . recently , i saw a little girl that was months from puberty at 8 years old , we see that more and more at 9 and up , but 8 really throws you . i hate to say this , but this information has been out for decades , meat eaters are foolsi would add those who eat dairy and eggs to your list as well . i think they are only fools once they learn about the dangers and continue to consume them . unfortunately many health care professionals are missing the opportunity to point out the way to eat as well as its importance.dr.s suspected my 12yr old of having underlying chronic illness because she had not yet reached menarche . 13 1 / 2 now and signs are there but she is hoping not to deal with it til after 14 like her mother and grandmother . both her and i are vegan , grandmother not but in postwar germany everyone virtually so.i don â t think it is milk and meat in general that are causing early puberty. there are societies that consume almost nothing but milk and meat ( mongolian , african herders , native americans who ate so little starch that today they are high risk for diabetes , and inuit almost purely meat and fish ) and i don â t think these traditional societies ever had a problem with menstruating 9 year olds . the reason we are seeing precocious puberty is due to modern pollutants that mess with the endocrine system . petrochemicals mimic estrogens , are xenoestrogens . also we feed kids foods that make them obese and body fat actually makes some of its own estrogen . kids don â t walk to school or play outside like they used to because of fear of molestors and parents getting charged with neglect and their kids being put in cps if they walk or play by themselves in their neighborhoods . so , we are making kids fat and putting them into early puberty by our lifestyles and dependence on petroleum products in our entire lifestyle , most parents don â t even understand what xenoestrogens they are exposing their kids to with a plastic baby bottle filled with warm formula made from a factory farmed cow or soy. the moms rub petroleum based lotion on their bellies when pregnant and use chemical air fresheners in the house. these are all xenoestrogenic. we cant go raising humans in a soup of xenoestrogens and also make them obese through too much sugar and not enough activity ( and not enough vitamin d due to being inside all day ) and not expect bad results , in this case , a drastically lowered age of puberty has proven to be the result. animal protein , beef , cancer , cheese , chicken , children , dairy , diet , early onset puberty , endocrine disrupting chemicals ,

            "Query PLAIN-206: foods that may block cancer formation more than 85 % of breast cancers are sporadic and attributable to long-term exposure to environmental carcinogens , such as those in the diet , through a multistep disease process progressing from non-cancerous to pre-cancerous to malignant stages . how can we interrupt this process ? the chemical carcinogens formed in chicken , fish and other meats during cooking that i profiled in my last two posts estrogens in cooked meat and avoiding cooked meat carcinogens are so effective at transforming normal human breast cells into breast cancer cells that researchers have used it as a model of cancer formation to test out various plant-based interventions . visualize the jekyll to hyde breast cancer transformation here . for example , three recent meta-analyses ( compilations of individual studies ) reviewing all the epidemiological ( population-based ) evidence concerning green tea consumption and breast cancer risk concluded that green tea consumption may be protective . well , now researchers can put it to the test . see my 3-min. video cancer , interrupted : green tea to see what green tea can do to block the transition towards breast cancer caused by the cooked meat carcinogens . more on the chemicals formed by exposing mammal / fish / bird muscles to high temperatures : any other feats green tea can pull off ? see treating genital warts with green tea and treating gorlin syndrome with green tea . might white tea work even better ? see antimutagenic activity of green versus white tea . any other plants that might be able to smack on the cancer kibosh ( besides broccoli of course : dna protection from broccoli and broccoli versus breast cancer stem cells ) ? what about garlic ? watch my 4-min video cancer , interrupted : garlic & flavonoids to find out . should garlic be raw or cooked ? see how can i preserve the anti-cancer effects of cooked garlic ? i â ve previously profiled garlic in # 1 anticancer vegetable ( make sure to also watch its â prequel â veggies vs. cancer ) . other foods that may protect dna include kiwifruit ( kiwifruit and dna repair ) , cruciferous vegetables ( dna protection from broccoli ) , leafy vegetables ( eating green to prevent cancer ) , and plants in general ( repairing dna damage ) . what other dietary changes should we consider after a cancer diagnosis ? see : dr. gerger â s posts on the adverse health effects of cooking meat seem to focus on cooking â muscles , â but i wonder if the same problems arise cooking other animal parts , i.e. , liver , organs , etc . might there be something different about cooking muscle tissue that other organ meats do / do not have ? could low heat cooking of a 100 % grass fed , no hormone cow â s liver , say , be ok ? or say boiling bones from a similarly well-raised animal to make a stock ? we do so pray that he is wrong about our favorite foods , do we not ? got that right , patricia.not really . i don â t enjoy meat and have no taste for liver , trust me on that ; i â m just curious what the science would say since the term â muscles â was all that was specifically mentioned in dr. gerger â s videos summarizing the several research papers.yep , another â inconvenient truth â .liver for example , is the store house for toxic metals in the body . i learned this when i gave my first german shorthair pointer liver because it made her coat glow , her hair was soft and silky . soft and silky fur is not something that german shorthair pointers are know for , but i attributed it to her diet . however , the downside of that liver , was she died of a cancer of the cells that line the blood vessels .. whatever it was called . this was the first and last time i had ever fed liver to my pets . and , to think , my mother forced my brother and i to eat liver as children.oh but the magic of â grassfed â turns everything unhealthy into a health food ! it â s magical ! umm â¦ sorry to have to mention this , but have you looked ^ up ^ recently ? even grass is being polluted by aluminum , barium , etc from chemtrails . see â what in the world are they spraying ? â on youtube . i still would eat low on the food chain , rather than eat animal organs that filter toxins . this poor planet.in the book , â the china study â by t. colin campbell , phd and thomas m. campbell ii , md , their research found that if a person eats 4 oz. of animal proteins , cancer will grow at a slower rate than if someone at 8 oz. of animal proteins . another study was done with 2 oz .. of animal proteins and the cancer slowly disappeared . one more was done on an all plant based proteins and the cancer disappeared at a much faster rate . it â s important to detox , then you have to go to a 100 % holistic / alkaline diet . no sugar . sugar feeds infections and feeds cancer.i â m always annoyed when i read a headline that says â this ( insert favorite food name here ) may prevent ( insert favorite disease here ) â or â eating so & so may cure cancer â , etc. beef , breast cancer , breast disease , breast health , broccoli , cancer , chemical carcinogens , chicken , cooked meat , cruciferous vegetables , environmental carcinogens , estrogen , fish , flavonoids , garlic , green tea , kiwifruit , leafy vegetables , meat , plant-based diet , soy , tea , vegan , vegetarian , white tea - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-216: plant-based diets for metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome , also known as syndrome x , is a medical disorder characterized by the so-called â deadly quartet â : abdominal obesity , high fasting blood sugars , high triglycerides , and high blood pressure . metabolic syndrome can set people up for liver disease , stroke , diabetes , cancer , and heart disease . it â s been estimated to afflict about a quarter of the american population . how do we stop it and how can we prevent it ? well , if it has to do with obesity , the level of fat in the blood , and high blood pressure then that would seem like a job for plant-based nutrition . in my 2012-2013 year-in-review presentation uprooting the leading causes of death i address the role diet may play in preventing , arresting , and reversing our top 15 killers , including many related conditions . we didn â t have data on metabolic syndrome specifically , though , until now . the results can be seen in my 2-min. video metabolic syndrome and plant-based diets . even after controlling for lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise , risk was highest in those eating non-vegetarian , intermediate for those eating semi-vegetarian , and lowest in those eating vegetarian , cutting the odds of having metabolic syndrome by more than half . we see that same step-wise progression towards lower disease risk the more plant-based one â s diet gets with high blood pressure , cataracts , diabetes , and obesity . to maximize benefits it appears we have to move towards maximizing the proportion of plants in our diet , but it â s not all or nothing . just adding more healthy plant foods to crowd out some of the animal and junk foods in the diet may offer significant protection . for example , consumption of three portions of whole grains a day appears as powerful as high blood pressure medications in alleviating hypertension . an analysis of a bunch of randomized drug trials suggests that taking blood pressure lowering drugs may reduce the risk of getting a heart attack by 15 % and the risk of getting a stroke by about 25 % , the same benefits attributed to three daily servings of whole grains . some grains appear to be more protective than others , though . watch my 2-min. video whole grains may work as well as drugs to find out which may work better . more on refined versus whole grains can be found in great grain robbery and is white bread good for you ? whole grains may in fact extend our lifespan ( what women should eat to live longer ) , but what about the phytates in whole grains ? see new mineral absorption enhancers found . and see antioxidants in a pinch for how to make your morning oatmeal even healthier . plant-based diets provide an excellent defense against the diseases triggered by metabolic syndrome primarily since these healthy diets provide the essential antioxidants lacking in a typical western diet . the healthiest plant-based diets contain little or no meat . and when such diets contain limited meat ( particularly red or processed meat ) , less potentially harmful heme iron is absorbed . when too much iron builds up in anyone having impaired antioxidant defenses ( i.e. , in those not eating enough plant-based foods ) , excessive oxidative stress will occur which can accelerate cell , tissue and dna damage . excessive oxidative stress can initiate the development of the disease associated with metabolic syndrome . most affected individuals harbor significant central obesity , which provides abundant lipids for harmful lipid peroxidation and more severe adverse consequences . those who already have two or more risk factors for metabolic syndrome will generally reduce their risk by increasing their intake of nutrient-dense , plant-based foods , and if their iron stores are elevated , reducing their intake of meat and / or by donating blood.since red meat is not good and fish is toxic and chicken has bacteria , is it okay to eat canned chicken ? donna , all meat naturally contains chemicals that damage the arterial endothelial cells , resulting in coronary disease . i wish it were otherwise , as the smell of broiling meat still makes me salivate , but unfortunately there â s no eating meat of any kind if you want to protect your heart . the issues about fish toxins and chicken bacteria are secondary . chicken and fish contribute equally with red meat to coronary disease because they are meat , not because of the secondary problems with them.is canned chicken safe to eat ? abdominal obesity , antioxidants , cancer , cataracts , diabetes , heart disease , high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high triglycerides , hypertension , liver disease , metabolic syndrome , obesity , phytates , plant-based diet , refined grain , stroke , syndrome x , vegan , vegetarian , white bread , whole grain , whole grains - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-226: bugs & drugs in pork : yersinia and ractopamine consumer reports recently released a study in which they analyzed u.s. retail pork and found trace levels of an adrenaline-like drug called ractopamine in about 20 percent of the samples and a foodborne bacteria that sickens nearly 100,000 americans every year called yersina in two-thirds of pork samples . ractopamine safety analysis the national pork producers council tried to address concerns about ractopamine by noting that the levels in meat of this muscle growth promoter , which is fed to pigs in the form of paylean â¢ and turkeys in the form of topmax â¢ , were below the limit set by the un codex commission last summer . what they didn â t mention was that due to outstanding safety concerns , the commission â s drug residue limit only passed by a single vote out of 143 ballots cast . the codex commission based this drug residue limit in meat on the only human data available , a study of just six people that wasn â t designed to establish safety . at higher doses , the study subjects reported their hearts racing and pounding â so much so that one subject had to be withdrawn from the study . at a lower dose , though , no cardiac changes were noted . so that â s the dose the codex commission used to calculate the maximum allowable meat residue and acceptable human daily intake levels . just because a certain dose doesn â t cause a problem in six people is no certainty that the dose is safe for everyone . the european food safety authority â europe â s equivalent to the u.s. food and drug administration â calculated that a study of six people wouldn â t even have the statistical power to pick up a 40 percent change in cardiac output , a key measured endpoint . to detect as statistically significant a clinically relevant change , the study would have required at least 60 people . also , the study only looked at the cardiovascular effects of ractopamine . given its adrenaline-like effects , the drug could also cause metabolic effects in people such as an increase in blood sugar levels or behavioral effects such as restlessness or anxiety . finally , all six study subjects were healthy young men . what about particularly vulnerable populations such as children or people with heart disease ? the european food safety authority panel concluded that the codex limit did not sufficiently take these higher risk populations into account . they concluded that the single small human study â can not be taken as a basis to derive an acceptable daily intake â¦ and consequently no proposal for maximum [ meat ] residue levels could be made . â in other words , we simply don â t have enough data to determine a safe level of drug exposure from meat . ractopamine â animal health and welfare the council of the european union recently joined china in reaffirming the ban on ractopamine , citing both human health and animal welfare concerns . studies over the last decade have shown that pigs on ractopamine may have chronically elevated heart rates , increased stress reactions , and difficulty walking . in fact the warning label reads : â â caution : pigs fed paylean are at an increased risk for exhibiting the downer pig syndrome , â a condition in which pigs are too sick , injured , or exhausted to stand and may be dragged to slaughter . the pork industry uses an ironic pretext to defend its use of gestation crates â restrictive cages that virtually immobilize breeding pigs for nearly their entire lives . the industry claims this is to keep them from fighting , but at the same time pork producers feed millions of fattening pigs a drug shown to increases aggressiveness and attacks . given the human and animal welfare concerns , why does the u.s. pork industry continue to feed this drug to their animals every year ? a meta-analysis was recently published in the journal of animal science . based on all the studies done to date , pigs fed ractopamine â had an overall carcass cutability advantage of 1.01 percentage units when compared to control pigs . â all this for a 1 percent greater yield . for more on this drug in the meat supply , see my 6-min. video ractopamine in pork . for more on the drug use by the livestock industry see : yersinia â the gift that can keep on giving the discovery of yersinia in pork is no surprise . pigs are considered to be to be the main reservoir for yersinia enterocolitica and pork products the main source of human infection . while most foodborne pathogens come from a variety of sources , 100 percent of the attributable yersinia outbreaks reported in the united states from 1999 through 2008 were caused by pork . what was a surprise is the level of contamination of the u.s. pork supply â 69 percent of samples tested positive â and the level of antibiotic resistance . ninety percent of the yersinia bacteria found contaminating the pork was resistant to one or more antibiotics . in most cases , yersinia food poisoning causes an acute â stomach flu â characterized by fever , abdominal pain , and often bloody diarrhea . severe cases are frequently confused with appendicitis , leading to unnecessary emergency surgery . long-term complications of infection include chronic inflammation of the eyes , kidneys , heart , and joints . within a year of a bout of yersinia food poisoning , victims appear to have a 47-fold higher risk of coming down with autoimmune arthritis . the bacteria may also play a role in triggering an autoimmune thyroid condition known as graves â disease . yersinia â the role of factory farming the new findings , published in the january 2013 issue of consumer reports , are not surprising given how widespread the infection is in the national herd . the increasing emergence of human infections over the last century has been blamed on the industrialization of the pork industry and higher stocking densities . inside swine confinement buildings , researchers have been able to culture yersinia bacteria right out of the air . the pork industry acknowledges overcrowding pigs is associated with increased health risks , but the trade journal national hog farmer cites research showing that when â space was dropped to 6 sq. ft . / pig , the building produced 26 % more pounds of pork at the same fixed cost . â that entails cramming a 200-pound pig in a space equivalent to about 2 feet by 3 feet . sometimes , the article concludes , â crowding grow-finish pigs a little tighter will make you more money . â with so many americans falling ill from contaminated pork , why are there no industry-wide yersinia monitoring and control programs in the united states ? perhaps this is because yersinia enterocolitica doesn â t cause clinical disease in pigs and therefore doesn â t directly affect the industry â s bottom-line . the costs of crowded confinement may instead be passed on to the tens of thousands of americans who continue to be sickened every year at an annual estimated cost of a quarter billion dollars . research from europe suggests pigs raised using organic methods â which in europe means more than just what animals are fed â may have 50 times lower odds of harboring yersinia enterocolitica infection compared to pigs raised on conventional factory farms . after studying a variety of factors , the researchers ended up attributing the low rates of yersinia infection on organic farms to lower levels of stress among the animals . if stress is indeed a contributing factor , things may be looking up in europe . on jan . 1 , 2013 gestation crates for pregnant pigs were banned across all 27 nations of the european union . crated sows have been shown to have impaired immunity , thought to be a result of elevated stress hormone levels related to being virtually immobilized for years on end . pregnant sows in the u.s. , where the majority are still crated , have been shown to have among the highest rates of yersinia enterocolitica infection . since infected piglets have been shown to carry the infection through to slaughter , the impact of stress levels on disease resistance of breeding pigs can have human health consequences . thankfully , major u.s. retailers , restaurant chains , and leaders in the pork industry have started phasing out gestation crates , which may end up benefiting both animal welfare and the safety of the meat supply . for more on this pork-borne bacteria check out my 7-min. video yersinia in pork . for more videos on fecal matter contamination of the meat supply , see : the campylobacter in chicken that i end the yersinia video on is the poultry and paralysis bacteria. if you are eating organic and constains statement that no steroids or antibiotics are used can they still contain ractopamine or yersinia ? no ractopamine , but â when production types and capacities were compared , the prevalence of yersinia pseudotuberculosis was higher in organic production than in conventional production â laukkanen , riikka , et al . â transmission of yersinia pseudotuberculosis in the pork production chain from farm to slaughterhouse . â applied and environmental microbiology 74.17 ( 2008 ) : 5444-5450. http : / / aem.asm.org / content / 74 / 17 / 5444.fullare humans more susceptible to pathogens from pigs than from other animals ( e.g. , cows ) ? i â m thinking of how heart valves from pigs are used in humans , so we must be generally more biologically compatible.some actual facts : pigs can get human diseases , and yes , some diseases go the other way . i â ve been subscribed to pro-med since about 1999 , and i â ve yet to see a report of â yersinia enterocolitis â as far as i can recall , much less one associated with pigs.in the consumer reports â study â , only 128 samples were taken and evaluated â but they also cite that they took â 148 pork chops and 50 ground pork samples from around the us â . discrepancies like that give science a bad name ! a tiny study like that is as silly as the study cited under the ractopamine portion of the article which used only six people ! there is no way that 128 samples is representative of all pork sold in the us , and without links to reputable studies , i can â t give that much credence at all.a much better study , of the pigs themselves , is available at http : / / naldc.nal.usda.gov / download / 29507 / pdf and indicated that 3.8 % of 2793 swine carried 106 different isolates of this bacteria which * may * be capable of causing human disease . and , of those , all were susceptible to 13 out of 16 antimicrobial drugs tested â which is pretty typical for any bacteria.again , a relatively small sample , perhaps , in comparison to the millions of pigs sent for slaughter each year in the us , but far better done than the one by consumer reports ! cook your food well , and choose your science with care â you â ll do a better job of protecting yourself that way , and be a lot calmer to boot . : ) adrenaline , consumer reports , foodborne bacteria , gestation crates , national pork producers council , pork , ractopamine , yersinia - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-247: how do plant-based diets fight cancer ? why do centenarians â those who live to be over a hundred years old â escape cancer ? as you can see in my 3-min. video igf-1 as one-stop cancer shop , as we get older our risk of getting and dying from cancer grows year by year until we hit about 85 or 90 , and then cancer risk starts to drop . it seems that centenarians are endowed with a particular resistance to cancer . so what â s their secret ? every day , 50 billion of our cells die , and every day , 50 billion new ones are born . there â s a balance . otherwise your body would shrink or get too crowded . sometimes we need grow , like when we â re a baby or for that growth spurt around puberty . our cells don â t get larger when we grow up ; they increase in number . a child â s hand may only be made up of about 50 billion cells and may have to add half trillion or so while growing up . once we â re all grown up , though , we don â t want a lot of extra cells hanging around . we still need our cells to grow and divide , but out with the old and in with the new . we don â t want to be making more cells than we â re putting out to pasture . when you â re a kid , extra growth can be good ; when you â re an adult , extra growth can mean a tumor . how do our cells know when to tip the scale in favor of more dividing with less dying and when to come back into balance ? a key signal is igf-1 , a growth hormone called insulin-like growth factor number one . igf-1 levels go up when you â re a kid so you grow and then come back down when you â re done growing . should your levels stay a bit too high as an adult , though , there â s a constant message sent to your cells to grow , grow , grow , divide , don â t die , keep going , keep growing . not surprisingly , the more igf-1 we have in our bloodstream , the higher our risk for many types of cancer . when you â re a kid , growth is good , but too much growth when we â re all grown up can mean cancer . in my 90-second video , cancer-proofing mutation , i describe laron syndrome , a type of dwarfism caused by congenital igf-1 deficiency . those affected don â t have that igf-1 spurt in childhood so they grow up short-statured , but not having an excess of igf-1 in their systems as an adult makes them nearly cancer-proof . this raises the question of whether one can achieve the best of both worlds by ensuring adequate igf-1 levels during childhood and then suppressing excess growth promotion in adulthood . this can be done with a plant-based diet as i described in my last blog posts cancer-proofing your body and treating an enlarged prostate with diet , as well as in my 4-min. video the answer to the pritikin puzzle . who is pritikin ? see engineering a cure . what â s the puzzle ? see ex vivo cancer proliferation bioassay . the binding protein findings i describe in the video may explain the findings in is it the diet , the exercise , or both ? for more on igf-1 , i â ve touched on it before in dairy hormonal interference and meat hormones & female infertility . pingback : how do plant-based diets fight cancer ? | nutritionfacts.org | plant based nutrition | scoop.it ( ) great article ! good information . several types of plants can help prevent cancer . but i think the diet also should contain fish , and especially fat fish to be optimal , because you then get a lot of omega-3 of the best type. cancer , centenarians , dwarfism , igf-1 , insulin , nathan pritikin , tumor - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-258: nuts don 't cause expected weight gain nuts are packed with nutrition , but they are also packed with calories . why , then , don â t nuts seem to make people fat ? in my video nuts and obesity : the weight of evidence , i profile a review published back in 2007 looking at about 20 clinical trials that had been done on nuts and weight . not a single one showed the weight gain one would expect . all of the studies either showed less weight gain than predicted , no weight gain at all , or actual weight loss â even after study subjects added a handful or two of nuts per day to their diet . however , the studies lasted just a few weeks or months . what about long-term ? maybe in the short run nuts don â t lead to weight gain as much as other foods , but what about after years of eating nuts ? well that â s been examined six different ways in studies lasting up to eight years . one found no significant change and the other five out of six measures found significantly less weight gain and risk of abdominal obesity in those eating more nuts . since that review is now 5 years old , in my weight of evidence video i update it to include all of the studies published since , including a number published this year . for example , in 2012 there was study in which people added over a hundred pistachios to their daily diets for three months and didn â t gain a pound . how did 30,000 calories disappear ? what happened to the missing calories ? the mystery has been solved . in my video series that started with solving the mystery of the missing calories , i presented the â pistachio principle â and the fecal excretion theory . in my next video these theories were put to the test . i then explored the dietary compensation theory , and by the final video in the series we had figured it out . part of the trick seemed to be that nuts boost fat burning within the body . but how ? it could have something to do with the amino acid arginine ( see my 2-min. video fat burning via arginine ) or the phytonutrients found in nuts and green tea ( fat burning via flavonoids ) . since nut consumption has been associated with lower rates of heart disease and living a longer life we should include them in our regular diet without worrying that they â re going to make us fat . does it matter what type of nut and were the nuts raw ? yes , does it matter whether the nuts are raw or roasted ? and what about salt ? my dad eats packaged â mixed nuts â every day and my mom is convinced that they â re contributing to his weight gain.if you count calories , how can you explain that you will gain 50 gram of weight when you eat 10 gram of sugar candy ? conservation of mass in physics should exist . counting calories is a myth . what do you think ? the laws of physics do apply but â weight â loss or gain is complicated by a variety of factors . calories are important but more important is calorie density . we tend to eat to satisfy our hunger which is calmed by stretch and fat receptors in stomach plus nutrients absorbed into body . weight loss or gain can be due to changes in muscle mass , water , fecal material and / or fat . in working with patients at the mcdougall clinic who are eating a low fat starch based diet i observe weight loss during their stay based on fat loss ( less calories consumed while satisfying their hunger ) , water loss ( less sodium intake ) and faecal loss ( due to increase in transit time ) . the best introduction to the concept of calorie density is the dvd by jeff novick , calorie density : eat more , weigh less and live longer . doug lisle â s presentation , how to lose weight without losing your mind â seen on you tube .. the laws of physics do apply but â weight â loss or gain is complicated by a variety of factors . calories are important but more important is calorie density . we tend to eat to satisfy our hunger which is calmed by stretch and fat receptors in stomach plus nutrients absorbed into body . weight loss or gain can be due to changes in muscle mass , water , fecal material and / or fat . in working with patients at the mcdougall clinic who are eating a low fat starch based diet i observe weight loss during their stay based on fat loss ( less calories consumed while satisfying their hunger ) , water loss ( less sodium intake ) and faecal loss ( due to increase in transit time ) . of course after leaving the program weight loss continues at about 1 / 2 to 2 pounds per week depending on exercise , where the patient started and how well they follow recommendations . the best introduction to the concept of calorie density is the dvd by jeff novick , calorie density : eat more , weigh less and live longer . doug lisle does an excellent job exploring the psychology and biology of losing weight in his two you tube video â s , â how to lose weight without losing your mind â and â the pleasure trap â ( he coauthored a book by the same title ) â¦ both also available as dvd â s . the complexity of the nutritional science can be appreciated by viewing the 56 videos relating to obesity on dr. greger â s website . i would explain a weight gain of 50 grams with only the consumption of 10 grams of sugar as being related to some other factor and not violation of the laws of thermodynamics . happy new year.but what about fried nuts found most everywhere ? fantastic source of knowledge . thank you so much ! i am still confused about nuts and omega acid profiles . i read that almonds are preferable to peanuts , but their profiles seem similar.pingback : using the motivational triad to eat healthier , part 4 : energy efficiency | leading effectively : official blog of the center for creative leadership ( ) how do i reconcile esselstyn â s recommendations for no nuts or avocado for people with heart disease with the info on nut consumption.i love eating raw non gmo cashew butter . but seriusly , i don â t understand paleo guys saying ohhh nooo , it â ll cause leptin resistance . must be those lectins messing with our hormones . what a joke . arnold schwarzenegger even ate cashew butter to gain muscle mass . cashews have a high dense protein amino content . ( protein keeps you sated longer right ? ) same goes for pistachios and walnuts ( added benefit of higher omega 3 ratio ) plz tell me if im doing something wrong in my diet . im a college student who relies on my tasty unsweetened natural nut butters . their easy on the pockets too along with sprouted breads i usenb : i â m getting a lot of misinformation about nuts , legumes , beans and sprouts causing leptin resistance . especially the the talk of lectins bears in mind . and for the record i have a shitty metabolism and am super skinny now thanks to good protein dense carbs , nuts , legumes and cooking with virgin cocnut oilamazing research ! i really appreciate your dedication to make these incredibly interesting videos ! i always use them to educate myself more and more about my plant-based-whole-food lifestyle ! thanks for your work dr. greger : ) - - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-269: preventing and treating kidney failure with diet our kidneys are highly vascular organs . that â s why when you see kidneys in the meat case they look so red . after all , our two little kidneys have to filter through our entire blood supply and as such receive about 20 % of our cardiac output every time our heart beats . so if the standard american diet can be so toxic to the blood vessels in our heart , back , abdomen , and pelvis , contributing to heart attacks ( heart attacks and cholesterol : purely a question of diet ) , spinal disc degeneration ( cholesterol and lower back pain ) , aneurisms ( abdominal aortic aneurysms : ticking time balloons ) , and sexual dysfunction ( cholesterol and female sexual dysfunction ) , what might it be doing to our kidneys ? in my 2-min. video , preventing kidney failure through diet , i profile a recent harvard study putting that question to the test . thousands of women , their diets , and their kidney function were followed for a decade . the researchers found three significant risk factors for declining kidney function in these women ; none of which come as a surprise given that we â re talking about clogged and inflamed blood vessels : animal protein , animal fat , and cholesterol . all three of these risk factors are only found in animal-based foods . no such association was found for plant protein or plant fat . failing kidneys can be a canary in a coal mine , informing us about the health of our blood vessels . quoting from the harvard study , â modest decrements in kidney function are powerfully associated with subsequent overt kidney disease , cardiovascular risk , and all-cause mortality , â meaning a shortened lifespan . â in summary , diets lower in animal protein , animal fat , and cholesterol may be protective â against this kind of kidney damage . what if the damage has already been done , and you â re already suffering from chronic renal failure ? that â s the subject of my video treating kidney failure through diet . one of the important functions of our kidneys is to filter out excess phosphorus from our bloodstream , and so when our kidney function declines , phosphorus can build up in our bodies and cause something called metastatic calcification , where your heart valves and muscles and other parts of your body can buildup calcium deposits and eventually result in skin necrosis , gangrene , and amputations . so , if a person has diminished kidney function their doctor will likely put them on a low phosphate diet , which is tough , because basically everything with protein has phosphorus . so both plant foods and animal foods have phosphorus . but vegans have been shown to have significantly better kidney function , on average , compared to omnivores . so while researchers concluded that â these results can confirm the usefulness of vegetarianism here and support the use of a vegan diet for the patients with kidney failure , â maybe it was just because the omnivores were getting a higher protein load . we know that lower protein diets appear to delay the progression of kidney failure , so did the plant based diet help because they were eating less protein or because the body somehow is able to handle plant protein better than animal protein ? to do that you â d have to split people into two groups , half on a vegetarian diet , half not , with the critical caveat to make sure both groups eat the exact same amount of protein and the exact same amount of phosphorus . and that â s exactly what researchers did . published recently in the journal of the american society of nephrology , they took vegetarians and put them on a meat diet , and then took meat-eaters and put them on a vegetarian diet . even though phosphorus and protein intake were kept the same in both diet groups , in the video you can see an illustration of the level of phosphorus stuck in the bloodstream of those on the meat diet , compared to those on the veg diet . something about plant foods appears to enable our bodies to better handle their phosphorus content . plant phosphorus appears easier to cleanse away . positive results have been seen with even semi-vegetarian diets , but the reason the new study â observed more dramatic differences after only 1 week , was perhaps because of the pure vegetarian diets used in our study . taken together , vegetarian-based diets may be beneficial for the control of phosphorus balance in patients with chronic kidney disease . â if we need another reason to eat a plant-based diet this would be a good one to add to the exhaustive list.thank you for great information presented in in easily digestible fashion . love the videos too ! a good video , but my compputer had you speaking over yourself about a different topic . i â m not sure if everyone has this problem , but i did , and it â s under no other e-mail i have ever read.hi michael , i am a great fan of the extraordinary work you do . i have 4 questions for you : 1- in the spanish study , crossover study of diets enriched with virgin olive oil , walnuts or almonds . effects on lipids and other cardiovascular risk markers , how significant are the results of this study considering the fact that the groups went from a baseline intake of cholesterol of 231 mg / d to about 130 mg / d when they change from their regular diet to the experimental diet with olive oil or nuts ? 2- when you attended mcdougall adavance weekend last february you were going to ask a question following fuhrman â s and mcdougall â s debate . i am curious to know what you were going to ask ? i am assuming that you are not a great supporter of mcdougall â s high cho diet . 3- contrary to mcdougall dr. willett from harvard substantiates well the need for pufa and mufa in the diet . what is your take on willett position ? 4- what is the risk for vegans who eat the way you suggest to become deficinet in dha , as reported by fuhrman ? thank you for taking the time to answer these questions , andrÃ© sainedr . greger , thank you for all that you do.is there any risk in worsening chronic kidney disease with a vegan diet , due to the increased potassium in plant foods ? if someone has diminished gfr , would the extra potassium from plants overwhelm there glomeruli or would it bring their kidney function back ? thank you.i still don â t understand if a diabetic with kidney problems can still eat plant-based protein or should plant-based proteins be eliminated as well ? when one reads about a renal diet , which is low protein , are nutritional guidelines including plant-based proteins or not ? can â t figure this out ! icarole : i can â t comment on your specific condition of diabetes * and * kidney problems . ( what a bummer ) . but i did want to respond to this part of your comment : â can still eat plant-based protein or should plant-based proteins be eliminated as well ? â i don â t think the question fully makes sense since all plant foods have protein . you might be surprised at how much protein even veggies have . so , unless you were planning on never eating plants , you can â t eliminate plant based proteins . you could try to eat plants that only have less proteins , but then you would be missing out on some super-healthy foods â foods that in general are less in protein than animal foods i believe . so , i don â t see how you could go wrong eating them ? ? ? ( i â m not a doctor and don â t know about advising you for your specific condition . ) for a really great tutorial in understanding proteins and our need for it and how much plants of all types have , check out this awesome page : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.htmli hope this helped at least a little . good luck. animal fat , animal protein , cholesterol , harvard study , heart attacks , kidney , meat , plant fat , plant protein , standard american diet - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-290: coffee caveats last month in the american journal of clinical nutrition , an editorial entitled â coffee consumption and risk of chronic diseases : changing our views â reviewed the growing evidence that for most people , the benefits of drinking coffee likely outweigh the risks . for example , a recent analysis of the best studies published to date suggests coffee consumption may lead to a modest reduction in overall cancer incidence , as detailed in my 1-min. video coffee and cancer . each daily cup o â joe was associated with about a 3 % reduced risk of cancers , especially bladder , breast , mouth , colorectal , endometrial , esophageal , liver , leukemic , pancreatic , and prostate cancers . what about the caffeine , though ? glad you asked ! check out what about the caffeine ? there are a few caveats . some health conditions may be worsened by coffee , such as insomnia , anxiety , gastroesophageal reflux ( heartburn ) , high blood pressure , and certain heartbeat rhythm irregularities . there are also compounds in coffee that increase cholesterol levels , but are effectively removed when filtered through paper , so drip coffee is preferable to boiled , french press and espresso . pregnant women should restrict caffeine consumption to less than two cups of coffee a day . despite the growing evidence of health benefits associated with coffee consumption , i still don â t recommend people drink it â not because it â s not healthy , but because there are even healthier choices . in this way , coffee is like a banana , another common convenient plant product . if you have a choice , i â d encourage you to make healthier fruit choices ( apples are better , berries are best ) . similarly , when it comes to beverages , i â d encourage you to choose an even healthier one , like green tea. is there any current information linking caffeine to migraines ? off to eat my morning banana â¦ errr â¦ apple ! ! headaches ( ha ) are common . it is important to correctly diagnose the type of headache you have . in my experience many patients who say they have migraines may be suffering from musculo-skeletal ha â s ( most common ms ha â s originate in upper neck and are felt along the back of the head or from temporal mandibular jt and felt on the side of the head ) . caffeine withdrawal ha â s are another type of ha . assuming the correct diagnosis of migraines â¦ they are often associated with food triggers . in my experience avoiding foods that are high in tyramines ( a naturally occurring compound which is also a breakdown product of the amino acid tyramine ) is particularly helpful . it is particularly high in processed foods and increases in leftovers . the challenge is that it occurs in both animal products such as cheeses , processed and most meats and plant products such as nuts and snow peas . the best approach is to go on a plant based diet and when you get a migraine to list everything that you ate or drank within previous 24 hours . it does get tricky because it is the amount consumed that seems to be critical not stress . when under stress people tend to eat out , skip meals ( thereby eating more when they eat ) or eat leftovers . my patients always preferred avoiding migraines as opposed to treating them although they would occasionally â push the envelope a little for foods like chocolate â . caffeine which is actually added to some old migraine treatments like â cafergot â seems to be able to trigger migraines but it can depend on the amount , type and brewing characteristics . good luck.lowrie , if you â re addicted to caffeine , for sure you â re going to get a migraine if you don â t have your coffee and you won â t be able to function until you get your fix . it â s not a nice situation and so , i wouldn â t start drinking coffee if you don â t now . i don â t see anything wrong with a banana . it â s a good source of vitamin b6 which neither apples nor berries have , manganese which apples don â t have and has equivalent amounts of dietary fiber and vitamin c to an apple or berries . what about cholesterol in instant coffee ? coffee as with all plants don â t contain cholesterol . i don â t drink instant coffee but unless they add some animal product to it it should contain no cholesterol.it seems to me that any food or beverage that is habit forming and causes withdrawal symptoms when removed from the diet should never be considered as health promoting.abstention from such products seems like a â no brainer â to me.hello mr. greger , are you going to post any video on the possible reason for the higher incidence of colorectal cancer among vegetarians in the epic-oxford study ? thank you ! â carlogreen tea should be avoided when receiving treatment with velcade for mm cancer â it is proven to reduce the positive results . pingback : quick collard wraps & blogging schedule ( ) i â ve reviewed ray kurzweil â s fantastic-voyage.net health guide . kurzweil is a very smart guy and very science literate , so in my mind there is , at least , a presumption of credibility . he recommends an alkaline diet , and specifically recommends drinking alkalyzed water and avoiding coffee because of its high acidity . are you aware of any peer-reviewed studies supporting or opposing this recommendation ? thanks very much , and thank you for your extremely credible and purely science-based recommendations . dr. greger covers alkalized water here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / alkaline-water-a-scam / as for alkalinity , almost all plant foods will produce a potential renal acid load ( pral ) that is negative ( alkaline ) because of the amino acid makeup . grains are very slightly acidic but most animal products are several times times more acidic . the pral can be calculated with this formula pral = 0.49 ( protein ) + 0.037 ( phosphorus ) â 0.021 ( potassium ) â 0.026 ( magnesium ) â 0.013 ( calcium ) . http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 7797810 you can go to the usda nutrition database and calculate the alkalinity or acidity of certain foods this way using a 100 gram serving sample.http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / here are a list of common plant foods . a negative number indicates alkalinity whereas positive means acidity . cereals , oats , regular cooked with water , w / o salt / 2.18bananas , raw / -6.93blueberries , raw / -1.04rice , brown , long-grain , cooked / 2.18broccoli , cooked

a buffer . â http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / 128 / 6 / 1051.full this acidic environment increases the production of cortisol which further diminishes bone density.http : / / ajprenal.physiology.org / content / 284 / 1 / f32.full.pdf this chronic acid load people put on their body causes bone loss leading to osteoporosis later on in life . if coffee has some health benefits , it â s probably due to its high content of chlorogenic acid , an antioxidant which in the amounts in coffee may hinder iron absorption . foods with more reasonable amounts of chlorogenic acid include green tea , sunflower seeds , artichokes , blueberries , cilantro , carrots , tomatoes and peanuts . coffee also has its downside . i agree with jaxon â that any food or beverage that is habit forming and causes withdrawal symptoms when removed from the diet should never be considered as health promoting . abstention from such products seems like a â no brainer â â there are many foods and beverages , such as those above which are better to eat and drinki realize that this may be way too much information , but i find that drinking a cup of coffee makes me regular . : -oi am little conflicted your other video seems to imply you have no problem with coffee but here you say drink green tea instead ? maybe it would be good to write in the description of the video that you think that while coffee isn â t that dangerous that there are better choices . as the video implies coffee is healthy . maybe do a more recent video saying which drink is the healthiest to drink â¦ or the top selection of drinks that are best . and to remind people balance is key . drinking multiple drinks.hi dr. greger , i noticed your articles about coffee : http : / / www.huffingtonpost.com /

coffee-caveats / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / what-about-the-caffeine / however you are missing an elementary factor that could explain why people would live longer while consuming coffee despite it being bad for you : those who consume the most coffee tend to have higher incomes . these population studies are biased because comparatively wealthier professionals drink more coffee . for example , lower tier jobs often don â t have break rooms or areas with a coffee maker available and you cannot just make a cup and drink it anyway even if you have an on-site coffee maker . it is well known that having more wealth and higher job autonomy leads to better health outcomes because such people have more control over their lives , they have more optimism , stronger self-belief and also much less stress , but the poor have everything against them in those regards . see susan rosenthal â s free e-book â power and powerlessness â : http : / / susanrosenthal.com / power-and-powerlessness for more detail about how economic factors and workplace autonomy impact health.here is evidence of the income disparity involved in coffee consumption : â demographic and

of cannabis . dependence on it has a marked physiological component . in objective terms , coffee is a stronger drug than pot , with a greater potential for toxicity.coffee is a powerful stimulant drug , causing dependence ( even 1 cup / day ) and illness â bladder irritation , stomach upset , headaches , anxiety , restlessness , heart palpitations , insomnia , elevated serum cholesterol , hypertension , prostate problems , etc.coffee contains 39 alkaloids , decaf coffee 38 . and these are not inert , producing the same health problems as regular coffee.coffee â s true identity as a

may be a decaf but it still carries a kick . scientists studying coffee have found that a triple espresso has a marked effect , regardless of whether it contains caffeine.the beverage caused an increase in the activity of the nervous system in both occasional and regular coffee drinkers , and the blood pressure of occasional drinkers rose.roberto corti , a cardiologist at the university of zurich who led the study of 15 volunteers , said it was the first time such disparities had been reported . he said the results , published in circulation , the journal of the american heart association , suggest an unknown ingredient in coffee other than caffeine stimulates the heart . coffee contains hundreds of different substances . â until now we have attributed the cardiovascular effects of coffee to caffeine , but we found non-coffee drinkers given decaffeinated coffee also display these effects , â he said . â this demonstrates how little we know about the effects of one of our most popular beverages . â one implication of the findings is that the potentially adverse effects of coffee on the heart could be less hazardous in regular drinkers with normal blood pressure . whether people with high blood pressure should avoid decaffeinated coffee remains unclear.the link does not appear to work . can you find the actual studies and post here ? i â ll be sure to investigate . thanks , bortogalthough coffee is brewed and filtered , there is still this probelm : http : / / www.foodproductiondaily.com / quality-safety / crisps-and-coffee-highest-acrylamide-levels-warns-uncrisps and coffee highest acrylamide levels , warns u.n.07 / 03 / 2005- a global risk analysis of nearly 7000 food items finds french fries , potato crisps and coffee recording the highest contamination levels of the carcinogen acrylamide , warns un committee , writes lindsey partos.scientists from 15 countries meeting under the aegis of jecfa , the un â s committee on food additives , caution that the harmful contaminant acrylamide in certain foods may be of public heath concern since it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.in april 2002 , acrylamide came to the attention of the food industry when scientists at the swedish food administration first reported unexpectedly high levels in fried , baked , grilled , toasted or microwaved carbohydrate-rich foods , for example chips , roast potatoes , crisps and bread.since then , an international effort of more than 200 research projects has been initiated around the world with their findings co-ordinated by national governments , the european union and the united nations.in the absence of any health-based guidance values ( tolerable intake levels ) for acrylamide , and a bid to construe a way forward to slicing this potential carcinogen out of the food chain , scientists meeting in rome last month assessed national dietary intake data for 17 countries . â the major contributing foods to total exposure for most countries were potato chips ( 16-30 per cent ) , potato crisps ( 6-46 per cent ) , coffee ( 13-39 per cent ) , pastry and sweet biscuits ( 10-20 per cent ) and bread and rolls / toasts ( 10-30 per cent ) . others foods items contributed less than 10 per cent of the total exposure , â the committee reports.tackling this figure , the un group urged national food safety authorities to work towards improving food preparation technologies that â lower significantly the acrylamide content in critical foods . â acrylamide appears to form when dietary items , typically plant commodities high in carbohydrates and low in protein , are subjected to high temperatures during cooking or other thermal processing.scientists now know that the most important precursor is the free amino acid asparagine which reacts with reducing sugars in the maillard reactions that also form colour and flavour.since 2002 research has shown that although trace amounts of acrylamide can be formed by boiling , significant formation generally requires a processing temperature of 120 c degrees or higher.most acrylamide is accumulated during the final stages of baking , grilling or frying processes as the moisture content of the food falls and the surface temperature rises , with the exception of coffee where levels fall considerably at later stages of the roasting process.acrylamide seems to be stable in the large majority of the affected foods , again with the exception of ground coffee for which levels can decline during storage over months . since formation is dependent on the exact conditions of time and temperature used to cook or heat-process a food , there can be large variations between brands of the same product and between batches of the same brand . large variations are also to be expected during cooking although this aspect has been less well documented.the composition of the food also has an influence , crucially the content of free asparagine and reducing sugars . varietal , storage and seasonal variations can occur . within ranges of natural variation , the limiting precursor in cereals is asparagine while fructose and glucose are more important in potatoes . other important factors are ph and water content.in a review submitted to the un group by europe â s â¬ 600 billion food and drink industry ( ciaa ) apparently recent investigations have achieved a 30 to 40 per cent reduction in acrylamide levels of potato crisps by introducing several adjustments in the existing production procedures.but the un committee states : â the detailed data behind this calculation were not reported and it is not known to what extent it has been applied by crisp producers . â significant reduction was also reported from process-optimisation for non-fermented crispbread , while little progress was obtained so far in reducing levels in various other important intake sources , for example , roasted coffee and breakfast cereals.according to findings from the additive group the most efficient reduction has been achieved by using the enzyme asparaginase to selectively remove asparagine prior to heating . â although tested both in cereal and potato models , the use is probably limited to specific food products manufactured from liquidised or slurried materials , â says the group.several other means of lowering the precursor levels can be applied at various stages of the food chain , for instance , by variety selection and plant breeding , controlling growth and storage factors affecting sugar concentrations in potatoes , pre-treatment of potato pieces by soaking or blanching , and prolonged yeast fermentation time in breadmaking.other mitigation possibilities include alteration of the product composition : addition of competing amino acids or acidic compounds , and alteration of process conditions â lowering the frying temperature.but a key obstacle to this progress is the fact that the feasibility of adapting these methods to large-scale food processing has not been â completely studied â in most cases.furthermore , any major changes would need to be checked for consumer acceptability , nutritional quality , and the possible increased formation of other undesirable substances.in its final recommendations , the committee urged : continued efforts to cut acrylamide concentrations in food ; and continued work on using pbpk modelling to better link human biomarker data with exposure assessments and toxicological effects in experimental animals.in addition , the committee highlighted the need for more occurrence data on acrylamide in foods consumed developing countries.thanks for the information ! feel free to share any studies on coffee and acrylamide here . we â ll look into ! apples , bananas , berries , bladder , breast cancer , caffeine , cancer , cholesterol , chronic disease , coffee , colorectal cancer , green tea , heartburn , high blood pressure , insomnia , liver cancer , prostate cancer - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-319: bowel movements : the scoop on poop years ago we learned that those eating plant-based diets are just â regular â people . in a study comparing omnivores , vegetarians , and vegans profiled in my bowel movement frequency video , researchers found a â very clear trend towards an increasing number of bowel movements with a more rigorous degree of vegetarianism . â for example , even meat-eating women who piled on the fruits and veggies and ate the same amount of fiber had only a quarter the odds of having a daily bowel movement compared to women eating vegan . but does this translate to decreased disease risk ? this year marks the 40th anniversary of the publication of painter and burkitt â s landmark paper â diverticular disease of the colon : a deficiency disease of western civilization â ( pdf here ) . just as scurvy is a vitamin c deficiency disease , they argued , diverticulosis is a fiber deficiency disease , the result of not eating whole plant foods . no surprise , then , that the majority of older americans are afflicted with this condition . as i explain in my diverticulosis video , a lifetime of straining to pass stools that aren â t softened and bulked up by fiber can eventually balloon pockets out through the weakest points in the wall of our colons . these bulging outpouchings can get inflamed , infected , and even lead to a life-threatening rupture of our intestines . more than 100,000 americans are hospitalized every year for this preventable condition . this summer , a team of scientists at oxford released the results of a study ( pdf here ) in which 15,000 vegetarians and vegans were followed for nearly a dozen years . compared to meat eaters , vegetarians had 35 % less risk of being hospitalized or dying from diverticulitis , and those eating vegan appeared to eliminate 78 % of the risk . what â s most surprising is that even after controlling for fiber intake , those on plant-based diets still had significantly lower risk , leading the researchers to suggest that meat itself may increase the risk of diverticular disease â by altering the metabolism of bacteria in the colon , which could lead to a weakening of the colon wall â¦ . â in addition to enhanced regularity , vegetarians and vegans also get points for achieving the preferred stool size and shape . the bigger the better . for example , one reason why women eating vegetarian may have lower breast cancer rates is because they have larger bowel movements , the topic explored in last friday â s video , relieving yourself of excess estrogen . on monday , stool size matters offered a tip on how to use beets to measure one â s intestinal transit time , and tuesday â s food mass transit revealed that it may take an average of four days for food to get from one end to the other in women eating a standard american diet , too slow to meet the target half-pound-minimum fecal output for optimal cancer prevention . yesterday â s bowels of the earth contest revealed which country has the largest average stool size ( i.e. who â s # 1 at number 2 ) , and which population has the smallest ( new yorkers ! ) . please feel free to leave any questions you may have about this entry below , and feel free to check out all the videos on fiber as welli â m a retired physician who has heard you speak a couple of times and enjoy your material and approach but i â m a fast reader and would like to read your material . how can i do this.hi dr. gregor , i suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction ( i think ) and have no issue with transit time as per a recent sitz marker test . what i do experience though is an intense pain over my right eye when i cannot have a bowel movement . also , i have virtually no sensation in my rectum . might you know what is causing my difficulties or what i can do to help ? i am vegan and have been for over 3 years.off topic i know doctor , but i wanted to know if you can help offer direction on getting off of my blood pressure medicine . i only take a low dose , but when i stop , my blood pressure does go up into a borderline range . i am vegan , and do regularly eat red lentils . thanks in advance ! bananas , 20 a day , blended with berries and flax ( ground ) seeds , dates as snacks and any other whole fruit or veggie . every night eat a handful of pecans with a one-pound salad consisting of purple cabbage , kale , broccoli and spinach . eat more if you can . use a fat-free dressing like catalina . give it a month and you â ll be off your meds . see your doctor before stopping your prescription . get off slowly ; lots of that stuff can have serious withdrawals.hi david , i â d have to know a little more about your diet and exercise habits to give you a more detailed answer , but off the top of my head : are you watching your sodium intake http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / salt-ok-if-blood-pressure-is-ok processed foods are one of the worst offenders as far as sneaking sodium into your diet . vegan cheeses and meat substitutes are loaded with the stuff . regular exercise is also one of your best weapons against high blood pressure.any opinions on aloe vera juice ? a recent randomized , cross-over , placebo-controlled study failed to find any benefit of aloe vera over placebo in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome . there is , however , evidence that peppermint oil may help . in general , the available science suggests that the purported benefits of aloe are overblown , and given recent reports of aloe-induced hepatitis , i would recommend against ingesting it . applied topically , though , to second degree ( blistering ) burns , aloe vera does seem to accelerate healing . thank you so much for your question â i â m always happy to look things up for folks.this is all very interesting ! what about personal â experience â of the tmi kind ? my personal experiences differ from the results of these studies.ready for a little tmi ? ok , a lot of tmi ? : ) a few years ago , i decided to head toward vegetarianism . i also started eating very healthy â organic , local , fresh , homemade , etc . â and quit smoking . i took up a â flexitarian â diet , consisting of no meat on most days and small amounts of meat once or twice a week.at some point during that time , i also developed a rectocele ( unbeknownst to me until a few months ago ) . the last year and a half , i was feeling increasingly constipated , stools were difficult to pass and yet rather thin . of course , cancer was my fear . then i discovered the rectocele . i decided to up the fiber even more , via grains , veg and inulin . things became even more difficult . i was having the urge to defaecate every day , several times a day , but it was far from easy.this past month , i had two house guests back to back . they are both meatetarians , to keep them happy , i cooked meat , just like back in my olden days when it was a slab of meat as the main and the rest as sides.and wouldn â t you know it , regular bowel movements ever since . no splinting , no straining . they are the right color , larger in size , etc.i really hate to cave to this and leave my dreams of being a vegetarian in the dust , but â¦ . if i can avoid surgery for the rectocele i will . incidentally , wasn â t there a study recently revealed about the rather marked increase in colon cancer risk among vegetarians , perhaps due to the large amount of fiber and therefore the scraping of the intestines ( scraping releasing mucous , thus requiring healing followed by possible dna replication mistakes ergo cancer ) ? sorry to hear about the rectocele . there are many factors that go into the development of a rectocele as i â m sure you are aware . it is not unusual for the symptoms to be made worse by the increase in fiber and bulk of the stool . given your history it appears that you have two choices . the first to continue what you are doing to minimize the problems caused by the rectocele or to have the rectocele surgically repaired and to resume a whole food plant based diet . given the risks of the standard american diet as it relates to arterial disease , cancer , autoimmune disorders , obesity , diabetes , osteoporosis and neurological disorders it would be easy to argue for the surgical repair with improved nutrition . i haven â t seen the study that you are referring to but all the studies i have seen and the current best hypothesis is that fiber reduces the risk of colon cancer when all the other variables are taken into consideration . as each case is unique it is important to work with your physician ( s ) to help you make the right decision for yourself . good luck.about 6 months ago , i switched to a plant-based diet but am having terrible diarrhea . i cannot eat anything â healthy â ( especially legumes , green leafy vegetables and berries ) without almost immediate diarrhea . i sometimes go on a bread / cheese / meat diet for a day or two , just to obtain relief of the diarrhea ! is this something normal , in your experience ? even after eating essentially plant-based for 6 months , the diarrhea does not seem to want to disappear . i have had stool tests and blood tests , all of which are normal . i â m so sad and confused â¦ it seems like the world â s best diet , is turning out to be my worst nigthmare ! if you have any thoughts , i woudl be thrilled to read them . many , many thanks for your blog and videos which are truly fantastic , and very much appreciated.hey marilougarson , sorry to read about your diarrhea aka â mudd butt â . i know it sucks , literally . thanks for sharing with all of us . sounds like you might me getting too much fiber . i would be interested to know what your diet was on a typical plant-based day . also try consuming some probiotics ( no yogurt ) to boost your healthy gut bacteria . i â ve used gol ( garden of life ) raw probiotics and they did a fantastic job with regulating my digesting and relieving diarrhea constipation after a round of antibiotics or stomach buggreat article ! ! ! ! i â ve been vegan 3 weeks and notice the difference in many aspects of my health.dear dr greger , i have been vegetarian for about 25 + years and virtually vegan for about 5 years . i contracted prostate cancer some years ago ( i think ) although it was diagnosed dec 2012 ( gleason 3 + 4 ) . i have had a prostatectomy in march and am about to have radiation therapy but the medics have had me on the ct scanner four different times ( 4 hour round trip ) to set up the scanner and mark my pelvis area , but my bowel is never correct â too much gas or faeces . i used a de-gas pill and now they gave me laxatives ( 2 x 2 times a day ) which i took 1 x 2 times a day . i think the problem is timing because my bowel is very efficient and healthy , 1-2 movements every day , but they think i need laxatives.is a vegan bowel more likely than the average one to move waste in a continuing kind of process ? i had an enema last trip but they waited an hour before i went on the ct again . they told me the scan was fine on the day but now they rang to say there was too much faeces in it . i just want to get the scan right but i â m not sure laxatives are going to make any difference . any suggestions ? what about frequency ? i only go once a day and i would say it is large . just wondering if what people say about going after every meal is correct.hi dr . greger . i was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer metastatic to the liver . i am on a vegan diet and i go very often ( about 3-5 ) on bad days . my bowel is loose and sometimes i don â t feel complete evacuation . what can i do ? i have lost a lot of pounds and can â t gain weight on a vegan diet ( is that possible , i â m pooping more than i need to ? adirel : i â m so sorry to hear about your cancer . not only your cancer , but your other problems too.i â m not a doctor nor an expert , but i have seen some articles that address people who want to gain weight on a vegan diet . these articles suggested eating lots of calorie-dense , whole foods such as : nuts , seeds , avocados and maybe even olives . you can make all sorts of sauces and dips out of these foods . or even just load up on nut butters like peanut and almond butter . whether or not something counts as calorie dense or not might depend on a lot on your existing diet . if you are eating a lot of low-fat or fat-free salads and raw veggies , then just about anything would be higher calorie density â including say tofu.while you may not be a teen and / or an athlete , the following page may interest you . not all of the recommendations on the page are whole foods , but there are some good ideas that may help and it is a site ( vegetarian resource group ) that i trust. http : / / www.vrg.org / teen / veg _ athlete _ weight _ gain.phpsince i am not a doctor , i do not know if these suggestions are a good idea for your situation . i just thought you might find these ideas helpful.good luck.interesting. i thought it would be a no-brainer because of the fiber for plant-based dieters but even with plenty of that + eating protein slows it down . no wonder every time i turn my plant-based diet into a flexitarian diet i end up with smaller , more infrequent poo . i knew it was the protein but i don â t really eat that much . but it sure makes a difference . â good to know.hello dr.greger , when eating a plant based diet my increased bowel movements cause me to have to wipe so much that i begin to bleed , or there is already blood in my stool . i am a young male who does exercise and has been an athlete most of my life . how do i fix this , either through changing diet or through a certain type of bath tissue or etc . ? i dont think i can eat a plant based diet if i keep having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times a day ( # 2 ) thanksghee buttersnapssorry to read about your problem . going on a plant based diet does change the frequency and size of the stool â¦ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / bowels-of-the-earth / and http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / food-mass-transit / . this requires some adjustments and 2-3 stools is typical for those on higher fiber diets . based on current science benefits far outweigh problems . that said , bleeding can be caused by local irritation , hemorrhoids and other conditions some serious so it is important to have the correct diagnosis before embarking on fixing the problem . having your regular provider check would be a good idea . if the problem is found to be due to local irritation you can look at changing the texture of tissue , avoiding tissue with chemicals , gently cleaning with plain water and soft cloths , and protecting the area with creams / ointments which help while avoiding making the problem worse . based on a proper diagnosis you and your provider should be able to come up with an approach that works for you and your circumstances . good luck. beets , bowel movements , breast cancer , colon , diverticulosis , fiber , meat , omnivores , painter and burkitt , stool shape , stool size , vegan , vegetarian - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-343: three brands of nutritional yeast contain detectable lead levels but the risk is minimal note from dr. greger : in short , we found detectable amounts of lead in samples of frontier , kal , and whole foods brand nutritional yeast , but the lead levels were so low that they all comply with the exceedingly ( and justifiably ) strict california prop 65 standards . still , i advise pregnant women who eat more than a third of a cup a day on a regular basis choose a different brand . no detectable lead levels were found in bob â s red mill , bragg , dr. fuhrman , red star , or now foods brand nutritional yeast . nutritional yeast has grown in popularity and is being introduced into many new dishes and recipes . it has a nice â cheesy â flavor and texture that can be used in sauces and soups or sprinkled over salads and popcorn . dr. greger recently covered how the beta glucan fiber in nutritional yeast can modulate our immune system and help to maintain our body â s defense against pathogens ( see dr. greger â s video on nutritional yeast to prevent the common cold ) . it seems beta glucans can be found in many foods , including mushrooms , which have been shown to boost immunity as well . a safety concern arose when dr. greger was notified that california â s prop 65 warning stickers were found on packages of nutritional yeast , suggesting there â s something in it exceeding cancer or reproductive safety limits . it turns out the problem was lead . there are many contaminants in the environment and in our food supply , even found in our children , which is probably why california has such strict guidelines on contamination . for example , california considers candies with lead levels in excess of 0.10 parts per million ( ppm ) to be excessively contaminated . state law requires products that contain more than half of a microgram of lead per daily serving to carry a label warning consumers . could nutritional yeast carry lead levels this high ? we reached out to some of the companies who produce nutritional yeast in hopes to better understand the situation . we asked if they perform lead testing and if they could share any information . the results of dr. greger â s inquiries can be found in his video here . he was frustrated by the lack of responsiveness and so decided we should take it upon ourselves to do our own testing . the nutritionfacts research fund was created and thanks to generous donor support we tested samples from 8 companies for the presence of lead in hopes to spur them to do their own testing . we hired an independent lab to conduct our tests for lead . i shipped out 8 samples of nutritional yeast in their original package . the lab used standard practices for lead testing known as official methods of analysis set by aoac international . lab technicians determined the lead values based on california prop 65 standards . here are the results from the brands we tested : bob â s red mill - test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . bragg â test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . dr. fuhrman - test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . frontier coop â test report shows lead levels at 0.021 ppm . it would take six tablespoons a day ( based on the manufacture â s listed density ) to exceed the california office of environmental health hazard assessment maximum allowable dose level ( madl ) for chemicals causing reproductive toxicity . * kal â test report shows lead levels at 0.011 ppm . it would take seven tablespoons a day to exceed the madl . * now foods â test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . red star â test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . whole foods - test report shows lead levels at 0.012 ppm . it would take six tablespoons a day to exceed the madl . * joseph , are you comfortable with the fact that nutritional yeast is grown using synthetic vitamins ? even when a company states on the package â un-fortified / not fortified nutritional yeast â , that just means the product has not been fortified after the product ( yeast ) has been grown . but to my direct knowledge , any nutritional yeast you buy in whole foods or other health food store ( all the big brands of nutritional yeast , are actually grown using synthetic vitamins . if they don â t then add the vitamins in post-growth , well , they are allowed to label it un-fortified . end result , one is still ingesting synthetic , artificial vitamins.how does this sit with your nutritional path on this journey . ? are you at peace ingesting these non-food based vitamins in your diet , as a result of ingesting nutritional yeast ? how about you dr. greger ? synthetic thiamin , niacin , minerals , etc . ? does this really resonate with a plant-based diet ? joseph : reading the article , i was thinking about the same thing . the members of the vitamin b family in the nutritional yeast products i â ve seen are added ( either before or after the fermentation , i don â t know ) to the product , not directly from the yeast in the product itself . i might as well take b-complex pills , which are cheaper and more convenient if my objective is to get vitamin b. to the guest : there â s a product , made in switzerland , called bio-strath . from what i can gather from the manufacturer â s website , the b vitamins in it are not added . however , there â s no way of knowing how much vitamin b it has because the manufacturer doesn â t publish the information . and i â ve never used it , so i don â t know how effective it is.more than b-vitamins nutritional yeast offers beta-glucans . i think another unfortified brand is dr. fuhrman if you â re trying to avoid added vitamins.yeah , but are you comfortable eating nutritional yeast that has been fortified with synthetic b vitamins ? is this a reason not to , for you , or according to the science ? nothing about vegan eating says supplements are bad . i think the main goal of this website is to be healthy , rather than a religious adherence to popular definitions of purity . i think it â s up to personal choice whether someone eats nutritional yeast , as it â s mostly used for flavor ( we still need b12 supplements ) , unless research comes out saying it â s not healthful.i agree with you supplements are not bad . i take several supplements . the problem with nutritional yeast is twofold : 1 . nutritional yeast is a supplement masquerading as food . 2 . dr. greger usually recommends supplements only if they are truly necessary ( examples : b12 , d ) , so i â m intrigued as to why he recommends nutritional yeast . if it â s for beta-glucans , there â re other , whole foods that naturally contains them.supplements can be made by natural means , ingredients . b vitamins in supplements are synthetic , chemical based , totally not-natural , not plant-based , and have been ingested by humans for very little time , maybe a billionth of our existence . something does not seem natural as far as ingesting a chemical to get vitamins that humans are supposed to get from food . no ? do the research on how b vitamins are made , petroleum , etc . these things seem like drugs as much as drugs seem like drugs . why ? cause they are . it is semantics here . and nutritional yeast seems to be a supplement , chemical supplement , not a food . but hey , maybe these synthetic vitamins help some people . i am open to it.please test the lead levels in sunflower seeds and other other raw nuts and seeds that are commonly bought by vegans . sunflower seeds are known to pull lead out of the soil . i can not help but wonder about daily ingestion of nuts and seeds as far as heavy metals , current testing 2015.please also test lead levels in leafy greens , organic , grown in california . i read that current-day leafy greens absorb lead and cadmium , maybe no big deal , but hey , if you guys are testing , let â s go for it ! i â d rather not be taking in so much lead and cadmium , if this is the case.good points ! i just wrote about thallium and kale . perhaps this could be another nutritionfacts research fund project if we obtain enough donations and interest ? great suggestion ! chocolate is another plant that traps environmental heavy metals . worth looking into if you â re a cocoa lover.fantastic job guys in pulling this test together ! and in so fully explaining what the results actually mean for us as consumers . i â m so glad i don â t have to throw out my jar of red star in the pantry â¦ does the whole foods brand include the one in the bulk bin or was it something else ? it was their private label whole foods brand nutritional yeast , not from the bulk bin ( which i think is red star brand at least at the whole foods near me ) .there must be a typo in there somewhere , because you sayfrontier coop â test report shows lead levels at 0.021 ppm whole foods â test report shows lead levels at 0.012 ppmbut for both you say â it would take six tablespoons a day to exceed the madl â although the first product shows nearly twice the value of the second.good point , but keep in mind the manufacturer â s differs per brand . if you look at the lab report on frontier , 16 grams of yeast is about 1 / 4 cup . so it â s lighter than whole foods . the main thing is no lead was found anywhere in dangerous levels and you â d have to eat a boat load of nutritional yeast daily for any potential concerns.if you look at the reports whole foods is nearly twice as heavy as the frontier yeast ( 15 per 2t serving versus 8g per 2t serving ) . that â s how frontier can have nearly twice the lead concentration but about the same amount per serving . does that make sense bruce ? this is great to see. some cheese sauce recipes require 6 tbsp of this so i really need to watch for the brand . i was buying natural grocers in house brand but will def switch to one of the recommended ones . thanks a lot.i still think any brand is fine . even for cheese sauce , i doubt 6 tablespoons of the yeast is consumed , unless the dish is not shared . regardless , what i find interesting is the huge amount of buffer room when maximum allowable dose levels are calculated . it may be worthy to point out regulations on herbal supplements are far less strict and lead can be found in products up to like 10 micrograms per serving ! what about interactions with blood thinners ? ask your doctor if there seems to be any , but i have not heard of nutritional yeast causing drug-nutrients interactions.i am joesph just read somewhere about it â¦ maybe just the old thinners ( warfarin ) and not the new ones.aha. if you find the article or study you read feel free to post it here and we can investigate more . thanks , vince.i â ll look for it joe â¦ thanksno ! very different stuff , as red yeast rice is not recommended . glad we tackled this thanks for providing the link.ok bud and thanks . : ) so challenging to know what is being â offered â to us consumers . we are seeking a reliable source of organic nutritional yeast , and preferably one that does not kill us . knowing more about nutritional yeast ( ny ) is helpful , frustrating and concerning . rather know than not . we have been discussing eliminating ny from our lives period . thus aiming for good health , seek only organic produce , actually seeking true veganic produce as well . we care about what it is we provide our bodies with , and what we share with others . organic celery and other veggies can be dehydrated and made into powders in place of salty flavours â¦ maybe together we can brain flow and find a replacement of this fraudulent nutritional yeast as well ? do not trust anything from bragg â s since we learnt about its deeply hidden and yes , dark secrets . shame on them as well . let us all rise and start refusing to be toxic wasteland filtration units by becoming community aware ( that means sharing and informing one another for the benefit of all and the planet ) . do we sound extreme ? what are bragg â s deeply hidden dark secrets . give creditable sources please.let us start here , contains a lot of the information one could seek out by googling the product of bragg â s itself . keep in mind just because bragg â s response feel low key does not remove the toxic end product results . ultimately we each decide what it is we allow in lives to nourish us , we feel it is wise to back away from the questionable things . we feel this is such the case with bragg â s , and we do not feel we have seen any accountability from bragg â s itself , from the mislabelling misleading its consumers saying it contained no msg , to the fact is is not a low sodium option ; one teaspoon of soy sauce contains 177 mg of sodium , and the same amount of bragg liquid aminos contains 280 mg. soooo much not right with it at all . here is a link that combines a lot of the information you are welcome to verify as credible to yourself , and please feel free to share what you find out . lots of love to you and thanks for asking.http : / / theashbulletin.blogspot.ca / 2011 / 02 / danger-of-bragg-liquid-aminos.htmlthe link you shared is just a blog with peoples opinions and fear mongering . not a credible source . even the ex-bragg employee says there is nothing unhealthy about the liquid aminos.lulu , i appreciate the link but i have always avoided braggs liquid amino since it clearly prints the very high sodium level that you point out is much higher that traditional soy sauce , itself a very high sodium source . i would hope any well intentioned vegan would avoid high sodium products and thanks again for pointing this out . since i see it every year at vegetarian summerfest , some people clearly do not know.bragg does not claim health benefits from the liquid aminos . bragg liquid aminos is a healthy alternative to soy and tamari sauce . no table salt or preservatives are added.kikkoman soy sauce has 307mg sodium per teaspoon , the less sodium version has 192mg sodium per teaspoon . ingredients water , wheat , soybeans , salt , sodium benzoate ; less than 1 / 10 of 1 % as a preservative.bragg liquid aminos contains 320mg of sodium per teaspoon serving . if less sodium is desired , use the 6oz.bragg liquid aminos spray bottle and dilute it ( 2 / 3 bragg liquid aminos to 1 / 3 distilled water ) before using or spraying on food . ingredients : bragg liquid aminos is not fermented , is gluten-free and made from non-gmo soybeans and purified water . it is an excellent alternative for tamari and soy sauce.bragg does not add any msg to its liquid amino products . however , msg is found naturally occurring in many foods , such as mushrooms , tomatoes , parmesan cheese , and soybeans . since bragg liquid aminos is made from soybeans , there can be some very small amounts of naturally occurring msg . patricia bragg is personally very opposed to adding msg as a food ingredient to foods , and she is very sensitive to msg . many of our customers who are very sensitive to msg have never had any adverse reactions to bragg liquid aminos.in deep gratitude of your divine presencelots of love lulu love rose wild @ seagrass.caif bragg â s is so bad , why wouldn â t you provide links to show what you are saying is true ? sounds like a bunch of malarkey.helpful would be information on who up the distribution chain actually manufactures the nutritional yeast that is then labeled by those that were tested . i doubt all are manufacturers themselves . this company make the one i â m told that is sold in bulk at my local sprouts : lesaffre . i couldn â t find any relevant information on their website . bummer.lesaffre is the corporation that owns red star , in which we found no detectable lead.does red star offer any organic nutritional yeast options ? thank you for bringing this awareness forward . lots of love lului am not aware of any organic brand of nutritional yeast.there are several brands of organic nutritional yeast . starwest botanicals , from the fields , raw vegan source , bioreal , are some sold on amazon.thanks for that clarification , dr. g. googling the two confirms it ( it â s just not prominently stated on lasaffre â s website ) .thank you so much for doing this . so happy to see these tests and setting up the testing fund . wonderful stuff nf team . keep up the excellent work.i am wondering and i think i already know the answer to this question , but this kind of regards nutritional yeast . some nutritional yeasts have quite a bit of vitamin b12 , and there are other fortified products like non dairy milks than can provide quite a bit of b12 per serving ( my almond milk has i think over 100 percent ) yet it is recommended to still take a supplement . i guess i was just wondering why that is ? i have a mathylcobalamin that i take every 2-3 weeks or so , and i always kind of worry that i am not getting enough i guess ? we also garden and i try to eat some soil â¦ i guess i want some closure as to if the fortified food b12 is absorbed or not ? hi alexis . the b12 in nutritional yeast should count toward the daily value , however , in some cases it might not be enough and a supplement may be needed . i just wrote all about this in a recent comment on b12 . let me know if that helps answer your question ? thanks , josephyes ! thank you so much , that totally answers my questions ! = ) it is reassuring to have the knowledge and act according to it ! alexisthis is great , fun information . thanks for doing this ! do we know what the next project is going to be for the nutritionfacts research fund ? if there is a big announcement on what the next project is going to be , maybe that will spur a bunch of new donations â¦ thanks , thea ! we hope to know soon . we â re looking into future projects for the nutritionfacts research fund . stay tuned for more information everyone â¦ just a comment / suggestion : you use ppm , micrograms , and tablespoons in your article which is a common problem in nutritional discussions . these measurements do not translate well . i appreciate that you used the tablespoon to help relate the amounts to my diet . perhaps a note on the relationships between the measurements would help ? going from micrograms to tablespoons via the 1,000 / fold safety net firmly placed me in the â just-trust-his-math â state . i â d rather be in the â that-makes-clear-sense-to-me â state â¦ if you get what i mean . thank you for all your articles and videos . my comment pales compared to the good work you do.thanks for the great suggestion . perhaps we could have kept the values in micrograms . everyone has access to the laboratory reports and they can see the limit used for detection , the results , and the micrograms of lead found per serving . thanks for your nice comment and please continue to suggest ways to improve our website.on a related note , consumer labs found what they consider significant levels of lead and / or cadmium in the majority of the 21 cocoa and chocolate products they tested . i had been using unsweetened baking cocoa liberally , based in large part on info presented here , but their report certainly has given me pause . might it be time to update your cocoa info ? can anyone refute these ? ( i â d love to still eat nutritional yeast on occasion , but it was one of the last highly processed substances that i gave up when i made the switch to a whole-food , plant-based diet years ago . ) here are at least three potential issues with nutritional yeast of which i am aware : 1 â folic acid : most brands of nutritional yeast ( incuding bragg ) contain synthetic folic acid , which is bad news for health . ( folate , which you can get in whole plants , is just fine ) . you can buy dr. fuhrman â s ( pricey ) nutritional yeast if you want to avoid this issue . read about it here : http : / / www.drfuhrman.com / library / folic _ acid _ dangers _ and _ prenatal _ vitamins.aspx2 â neurotoxic msg : anything with that â umami â flavor is bound to be excitotoxic , almost by definition . * see here : http : / / www.daystarbotanicals.com / nutritionalyeast.html Â· 3 â genetically modified : the preferred source of carbohydrate for yeast is molasses from sugar beets or sugarcane . if it â s made using beet molasses , i would wager that the beets are genetically modified . does anyone have good information on this ? * here â s an excerpt from # 2 : â i really didn â t want to believe what i had heard â¦ i had enjoyed nutritional yeast on pop corn , in many vegetarian / vegan caseroles and menu items , and sprinkled on all manner of foods â and of course , in my â green drink â . this stuff is absolutely wonderful and delicious ! but now i had to come to terms with what we had learned . would i put my head in the sand and cling to my beloved nutritional yeast , or would i be an honest health reformer ? first , i would try to disprove dr. blaylock â s findings , as best i could , so that i might , in good conscience , continue using this delicious taste enhancer that doubles as a nutrition supplement â¦ â it doesn â t seem there are many studies to confirm any of these claims other than some epa regulations for manufacturers . the gmo question is a good one . i would simply ask the companies themselves if that is a huge issue . i can help look into more if you insist . this was a big topic of discussion on the previous yeast video . i also suggest reading thru the comments as other user left some valuable comments . i think there are far more worrisome products on the market than nutritional yeast . the good news is at least our results didn â t find any lead at dangerous levels.thanks , joseph . according to fuhrman , folic acid is clearly health-damaging â¦ that â s enough ( for me ) to rule out all nutritional yeast products except fuhrman â s , which costs $ 36 / lb . and unless i â m mistaken , free glutamic acid is petty much as health damaging as msg â¦ so that â s two strikes . i don â t base my eating decisions on the fact that other food choices are more worrisome ! that â s a good point â i don â t base my eating decisions on the fact that other food choices are more worrisome ! â however i still have yet to see any research about the harmful affects of free glutamic acid and nutritional yeast . the whole reason we tested for lead was because the yeast has been found to contain beneficial immune modulating properties . certainly you can avoid it if you â d like : - ) or go for fuhrman â s brand if more comfortable . furthermore , msg doesn â t appear harmful . feel free to post research studies on here and we can look into the glutamic acid concerns more . thanks , laurie.joseph- many ingredients are labeled as excitotoxins because of dr. blaylock â s findings . his findings have been regurgitated by many but where is the science ? when will we ever know ? exactly ! would love to learn more about this topic from published research studies.excellent article and thank you for the test result and detailed explanation . keep up the great work ! thanks johnny ! if you have not already , please consider keeping up with the new videos posted every weekday and subscribe to the daily video feed ! best wishes , josephi tried eating nutritional yeast for a while . i did not feel good while eating eat and i did not eat a lot of it at a time . i no longer eat it and do not miss it and do not feel that it is necessary in mine or anyone elses diet . but each get to choose for themselves.how about any other products with yeast ? wine , ferments , soy sauce , bread , kefir , kombucha ? how do they make you feel ? the only product you mentioned that i use is bread , and i do not eat that often . for grains i eat mostly brown rice , millet and oats . as far as how the bread makes me fell â i do not have a problem with it , but do not eat it very often.with the proliferation of coal-fired plants in china , the probability of heavy metal contamination in exported produce has dramatically increased . china burns 4 billion tons of coal in power plants , homes & factories every year . yet there are no checks for this even for â organic â labeled produce . a farm exporting produce that is adjacent to a coal plant , or even a smog choked city , is not a pretty picture . yet who would know ? i eat several ounces of â organic â pumpkin seeds daily that i â ve learned were grown in china . are there any home testing kits that you would recommend that can at least check for the presence of lead , mercury and cadmium ? if you can â t answer this directly , could you post such information on your web site ? thanks for the suggestion ! we used a lab to test for lead . i am sure you could do the same with food samples , but it may be more expensive . i honestly don â t know the efficacy of home test kits . good ol â google helped . i found this consumer reports article on lead test kits . maybe that â s a start ? i â m not even sure these test for food and the levels of detection are much higher ( like 2,000 parts per million ) than ours ( 0.01 ppm ) . of course , not buying foods from china eliminates the concern . let me know if you find other test kits ? hopefully others here can give us suggestions . - - -\n",

any advice you have would be greatly appreciated . i need to make a decision very soon regarding traditional ( western ) treatment or a better way . thank you very much , jeff j. jeffj / originally posted in preventing kidney failure through diet the nice thing about dietary interventions is that they can be undertaken in addition to whatever you and your physician agree upon is the right course of action in your case . unfortunately i â m not aware of any studies on the role of diet in surviving renal cell carcinoma . i do have videos on diet for bladder cancer survival , early stage prostate cancer ( in relation to flax seeds , saturated fat , plant-based diets ) , breast cancer survival ( in relation to soy , flax seeds here , here and here , saturated fat , and trans fat ) and reversing the progression to esophageal and oral cancer , but none that cover dealing with kidney cancer because it apparently hasn â t been studied . however , because cancer prevention and treatment may be the same thing in many cases , i would recommend you consider eating the kind of diet that has been associated with kidney cancer prevention . for example , in the current issue of one of my favorite journals , the american journal of clinical nutrition , this question was put to the test in what may be the largest prospective study ever , the nih-aarp diet and health study , which followed nearly half a million people for about a decade . noting that â plant-based and fiber-rich diets high in vegetables , fruit , and whole grains are recommended to prevent cancer and chronic conditions associated with renal cell carcinoma , â the study found fiber intake was associated with a significant 15-20 % lower risk of renal cell carcinoma and that the most powerfully protective foods included legumes ( beans , chickpeas and lentils ) , whole grains , and cruciferous vegetables . refined grain intake , however , was associated with increased risk . last year the same group of researchers found that cooked meat carcinogens may double the risk of papillary renal cell carcinoma . the only other new study i know of found that nitrite from processed meats and other animal sources ( but not plant sources ) was associated with an increased risk as well . finally , given that most of the new treatments developed for renal cell carcinoma ( axitiniband , bevacizumab , everolimus , pazopanib , sorafenib , sunitinib , temsirolimus ) attempt to block the formation of new blood vessels to the tumor , that would be all the more reason to pack your diet with foods containing anti-angiogenic phytonutrients such as apigen , luteolin , and fisitin found in strawberries , citrus , celery , peppers , and many other fruits and vegetables . in my volume 13 dvd i have a video on this whole concept called cutting off tumor supply lines . it should be up on the website in a few weeks , but if you email me your mailing address i â d be happy to send you a copy . i am enjoying all your comments and videos , so informative . i have a soon in the fitness industry who pushes the health benefits of whole foodsdear dr , can i ask also for one of your dvd vol 12 , cuting off tumor supply line . ? i would welcome it very much.it â s available on my website and through amazon ( all proceeds to charity ) , but if you can â t afford it i â d be happy to send you a copy , just email me your mailing address.thank you doctor for all your unconditional information giving to all without expectation ! i wish you long years of life with health , joy and prosperity . i â d like to get more information on borderline kidney failure ! since september 2012 suddenly my egfr â kidney function â dropped to 14 which is borderline failure , creatinin and bun at 55 and 3.9 without any specific reason . i have always eaten healthy , since i have juvenile diabetes for over 40 years which has been in control as much as i was able to . i became almost all plant based for the exception of having fish once a week for the past six years since 2007 . in 2011 i took two session of chelation to improve my overall health and then this kidney issue happened . please advice me any information to help me delay and or reverse my kidneys condition . i have nightmares about the â d â word and possible transplant . i thank you and pray for you always . may.16.2013maybe offtopic : is there any information on affects of radiation on food ?

is he a vegetarian or vegan ? i am not but will consider his advice . thank you . appreciatively , edwardedward . welcome to the site . i too find it to be extremely helpful.i can â t speak for dr. greger , but i have watched every single one of his videos . i â m pretty sure that the answer is : for optimal nutrition , stay away from meat , dairy and eggs . here is a link to a blog post in which dr. greger gives his nutrition recommendations : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / hope that helps.your website is outstanding and has helped save my life . i am 2-1 / 2 yrs out from cancer diagnosis and treatment . i found your site and am following vegan diet . i feel great and all tests are clear . my question : i have low thyroid and am taking natural compounded porcine-based thyroid meds twice a day . am i at risk of a pork-based virus or autoimmune response from these meds ? your pork video has me concerned.kathryn , i was taking the porcine meds , too , since i had a reaction to one of the binding agents in synthroid . it bothered me that , as a vegan , i was taking animal thyroid , so i asked my doctor for an alternative . i am now on tirosint and doing well . tirosint is not vegan . in fact , tirosint is manufactured with gelatin and glycerin . however , in my humble opinion , tirosint does represent an improvement over taking pig thyroid . hope this helps.eat sea vegetables for iodine and at least an ounce of brazil nuts a day for selenium.you might have gotten hypothyroid because of the high levels of oxilates in raw vegetables ( spinach i believe has .94g / kg ) . 16-30 g / kg i believe is lethal â not an expert ! ! ! i did some googling and i â ve been eating raw spinach for a long time and i have bad heart palpitations â¦ try more whole grains and try cooking or steaming your vegetables and leafy greens. you are lowering the oxilates in the vegetables and in handing absorption by cooking them as i understand it . any professionals please correct me if i â m wrong â¦ .good luck . ( ps . i just found this all out yesterday â but already i haven â t had a palpitation this morning . ) my main point was try googling oxalates and â the dark side of vegetables â and you â ll see lots of people talking about kidney stone formation and hypothyroid with raw high oxalates diets â especially juicing . and try cooking your vegetables in 16oz of water with 1 / 4th a teaspoon of iodized salt mixed in . the vegies taste great and salty and they don â t need salt to sweeten them up and you get your iodine to balance the oxalates â double win . diabetics with no / low sodium diets â just cook with water and no or very little salt . don â t cook or fry with vegetable oils or coconut oil or olive oil â cooking with vegetable oils i believe creates trans fats â pros correct me if i â m wrong â which is the worst type of fat you can digest â¦ we are lucky in america that most of the vegies we eat can be eaten raw because there are a ton of vegetables and leafy greens that are poisonous to us â but if they are cooked and the liquid discarded â they are safe ! ! ! i love science ! food for thought . god blessmay i ask your opinion of thermography for breast screening ? thank you.most likely renal cc â¦ small spots showing at both lung bases â¦ feellike my body is shriveling away before my eyes . will have partial nephrectomy hopefully sooner rather than later & i was told â not to worry â about the spots on my lungs . terrified and just don â t know what to think . would an extreme fast hurt or harm things ? any help about any aspect of this would greatly be appreciated.david10 years ago i was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer . a year later i heard that a whole-foods vegan diet could improve my odds of survival . i changed my diet 9 years ago â¦ and obviously â¦ i am still here . i can â t say absolutely that it why i survived , but i and my oncologist think so . he said there are studies underway now with women with breast cancer that show 30 % improvement of survival by just dropping meat intake to a low level â¦ i would recommend that you read â the china study â . oh , and as a side benefit , i love my diet ! i won â t ever go back , even if someone assured me i wouldn â t get cancer . it â s that good ! ken , that is * such * and inspiring story . thank you so much for taking the time to share.i agree with you , the china study is awesome . i wish they would teach it in schools.happy eating to you.dear dr. greger , can diet be used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist ) cancer ? gleevec has too many side effects . every time my sister eats the medicine , she has very low white blood cells so she must stop eating gleevc . she was operated on but still has high recurrence risk . many thanks ! hello , google alkaline water and try to see if your ruin and saliva is acidic or alkaline . ~ 7.3 is supposedly our constant blood level . meat , fish , eggs , dairy â cheese milk yogurt â and stress lower ph ( increase acid ) which is bad â whereas fruits , vegetables , and berries increase ph â good . dr. bernardo ( older white male veteran naturopath ) explains on youtube how he cures any disease and all cancers with a high vegetable based ph and a positive change in attitude . sounds like a great american ! ! ! ! good luck and god bless ! vegan diet does support optimal health and can be considered as a part of cancer management . the causal result relationship between any type of cancer and diet has been shown in many studies . here is a link to dr. greger â s video on diet and kidney cancer.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer / - - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-370: do microgreens have more nutrition ? what about microgreens ? vetstud / originally posted in antioxidants sprouting up usda researchers recently published a study assessing the nutrition content of 25 commercially available microgreens , seedlings of vegetables and herbs that have gained popularity in upscale markets and restaurants . just a few inches tall , they boast intense flavors and vivid colors , but what about their nutritional content ? no one knew until this new study came out . we â ve known that baby spinach , for example , have higher levels of phytonutrients than mature spinach leaves , but what about really baby spinach , just a week or two old ? microgreens won hands down ( leaves down ? ) , possessing significantly higher nutrient densities than mature leaves . for example , red cabbage microgreens have a 6-fold higher vitamin c concentration than mature red cabbage , and 69 times the vitamin k. microgreens are definitively more nutrient dense , but are often eaten in small quantities . even the healthiest garnish isn â t going to make much of a difference to one â s health . and microgreens may go for $ 30 a pound ! but byom â birth your own ! you can have rotating trays of salad you can snip off with scissors . it â s like gardening for the impatient â fully grown in just 7 to 14 days ! if that â s too long , what about sprouting ? see my video antioxidants sprouting up . homemade sprouts are probably the most nutrition-per-unit-cost we can get for our money . see biggest nutrition bang for your buck , where they beat out the previous champ , purple cabbage ( superfood bargains ) . broccoli sprouts are probably the best â see for example the best detox and sulforaphane from broccoli to breast . i would recommend against alfalfa sprouts ( even when home sprouted ) as fecal bacteria from manure can hide in the seed â s nooks and crannies and cause illness : don â t eat raw alfalfa sprouts . i have recently heard both positives and negatives about using maca powder . are there really any solid benefits of its use ? thanksi would also like to know your stance on maca root powder . some online sources say it â s a great â adaptogen â and so i â ve been adding it to my morning smoothies . are there any real studies / research on this ? or is maca another internet cure-all scam ala coconut oil ? is sprouted wheat healthier than regular ground wheat ? that is after the small root begins to appear and when it is no longer than the grain itself , does the wheat grain develop added benefits when sprouted ? sprouting does indeed increase the antioxidant content of foods significantly . chickpeas can have 10x the antioxidant content when sprouted. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / antioxidants-sprouting-up / what is your opinion on juicing ? dr. greger advises against juicing http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / a-harmless-artificial-sweetener / dr greger i hepatitis c so i am trying to decide if eating my vegetables is better then juicing them for the the detox effect of them.eating the whole vegetable will always be preferable . juicing throws out the fiber and much of the antioxidants.is there any link between being vegan and sciatica or nerve issues with a lack of b12 ? not as long as you have an adequate intake of vitamin b12 . check out the series of video â s that dr. greger posted in february 2012 . there however an indirect connection to lower back issues and diet that goes beyond vitamin b12 . check out the video on arterial disease and back pain â¦ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / cholesterol-and-lower-back-pain / . since the disc â s between the vertebrae get their nutrition by diffusion any interference with the blood supply to the lower vertebrae will result in more likelihood of disc narrowing and rupture with subsequent sciatica . arterial disease starts in childhood â¦ see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / heart-disease-starts-in-childhood / and the pday study showed aortic disease by age 19 and much worse at age 35 . obviously the earlier you begin the correct diet with adequate vitamin b-12 intake the better.dr greger : first of all , love your site and your videos . your charity to the world is just awesome . thanks for educating the populous regarding health and nutrition related issues.however , from the many dozens of videos that i have watched in which you talk about foods that are helpful or harmful to the body , the studies are based on single foods of food types ( veggies , nuts , fruits , etc ) . are there any studies as to the good for you foods offsetting bad for you foods when you combine ? i try to be good as often as i can but now and then i run into something like a broccoli slaw with raisins , sunflower seeds , onion , and then of course people have to put bacon in it too . clearly i could just pick the bacon out but the bacon is out numbered 50 to 1 as far as good to bad , so do i just eat the slaw and hope that next time there is a meatless option ? or , sometimes there only good option happens to have dairy in it , i.e. pasta with a nice tomato , basil , garlic , oregano sauce . do i not eat at all , or is the once and awhile bad thing that happens to come with much goodness ok ? most foods seem to be vegetarian with vegan being sporadic and difficult to run into when going to dinner or to friends homes to eat . even something as simple as salads â not everyone has all the good stuff such as fats from nuts or avocado when they have salads . is it better or worse to not eat salad at all , or eat the salad with a little of their vinaigrette and hope that the processed fats , in little amounts of dressing , only serves to help my body take in more of the fat soluble nutrients ? should i race home and power down a nutrient dense cocktail through my juicer ? side note â at home i am very strict so i am also hoping that my strictness inside my own walls is enough to counter the effects of not being militaristic when i am out and about with friends or family.what are your thoughts on the issue of having to sometimes live with combined foods from time to time or are their studies that deal with this ? many thanks in advance ! mjs _ 28s : i can â t answer your direct question , but i have an idea for you : a lot of restaurants will make you a custom dish if you just call ahead and ask for a vegan dish . â hi , i â ll be coming to your restaurant tomorrow with some friends . while my friends eat anything , i do not eat meat , diary or eggs . i saw your menu and was wondering if you could modify dish _ _ _ to includes lots of bla and bla , but leave out the bla . you could even add bla to make up for the lack of bla . can you do that ? â not all restaurants will do this , but many will , especially the higher-end ones.it â s just an idea to get you it all : a pleasant time with friends and family , a very tasty meal , etc . , without having to compromise on your values ( of good health , etc . ) . - - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-382: is vanilla almond milk healthy ? how about almond milk ? been drinking as replacement for cow milk , love the taste , etc . however , i do buy the vanilla sweetened flavor â¦ is that bad ? am i taking away from the good of it all ? mercman40 / originally asked in the best nut almond milk is certainly superior to calf â s milk , if only because of the lack of saturated animal fat , cholesterol , and hormones ( see , for example , my videos acne & cancer connection and trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero ) , but is unflavored , unsweetened almond milk preferable to sweetened vanilla ? in general , i â m in favor of cutting down on intake of empty calories whenever possible . we get only about 2,000 in the calorie bank every day â why not try to make them count ? so almond milk versus almond milk with added sugar is a no-brainer decision for me , but i guess it depends on what you â re using it for . if the only way you would drink green tea is with the sweetened variety , then overall it would be healthier for you to stick with the added sugar ( though your taste buds would probably adapt to the unsweetened variety , or you could try adding a harmless noncaloric sweetener such as erythritol ( see a harmless artificial sweetener ) ) . the vanilla question is interesting , though . given its popularity , i was surprised there wasn â t more science published on the health effects of vanilla orchid fruit phytonutrients . there are two in vitro studies that suggest vanillin , one of the many aromatic compounds in vanilla , may be protective against colorectal and cervical cancer , but no clinical or epidemiological studies have been published to my knowledge . there was also a study showing that vanilla extract may interfere with bacterial communication , concluding vanilla â might promote human health by â¦ preventing bacterial pathogenesis . â the most unusual vanilla study may be one published out of germany in 1999 . researchers wanted to know if our olfactory memory goes back even further than our verbal memory . do we subconsciously remember tastes and smells from our infancy before we could even put them into words ? they realized that there was a time certain german infant formulas were flavored with vanilla , so they challenged a group of adults with a vanilla-containing food . but they couldn â t just use your typical vanilla flavored confection because it could introduce too many other new variables . they had to choose something that no one would have ever associated with vanilla . so they concocted â¦ vanilla-flavored ketchup ! and guess what ? two-thirds of those bottle fed with vanilla as infants preferred the vanilla ketchup , whereas two thirds of the rest were like â blech ! â and chose the regular ketchup . the moral of the story is that perhaps if breastfeeding women eat lots of healthy foods , their broccoli-flavored breast milk might get remembered years down the road ! and indeed i even have a new video about that : the best baby formula . almond milk comes in 4 varieties in my store , plain unsweetened , vanilla unsweetened ( both 40 cal / serving ) , plain semi-sweet ( 60 cal / serving ) and fully sweetened vanilla ( 90 cal / serving ) . we , like mercman40 , like the vanilla flavor , but don â t really care for the unsweetened version and the fully sweet version taste like we are drinking melted ice cream ( good in a horrific kind a way ) . the semi-sweet is â just right â on the sweet scale , so we remedy the lack of vanilla by adding a teaspoon of our own vanilla extract to each half gallon . but i might have to try adding some non-calorie sweetener to the unsweetened vanilla and skip the extra teaspoon of sugar.please consider that when you are drinking store bought almond milk , you are most likely consuming added synthetic vitamins. it is high-time the consumer demanded ( suggested kindly ) to the producer to stop adding synthetic vitamins to our almond milk , as well as tons of other vegan products.yes ! i â ve been thinking this , as well . the only exception i don â t personally mind is b12 , and i suppose i can live with d being added to stuff as well . beyond that , no thank you ! it â s frustrating â¦ dr. mcdougall has flat out said that vitamin d supplements should be avoided , as in , don â t swallow anything that is either a vitamin d pill or a product that has been fortified with it . read the info. on his website . he thinks vitamin d supplements actually cause harm . not â correlation â , but â harm â . he is very clear on this.you mentioned erythritol , what about mannitol as a sweetener- is it safe ? one of my neuro psychology professors told us that artificial sweeteners aren â t the best because they can cause you to crave more sweetner than if you at regular sugar . i use stevia , but am sugar free totally , and noticed a new product called â truvia â . i looked splenda etc in the fda book that is really informational about all the additives , the studies done , etc and it says has caused cancer in rats .. like what doesn â t right ? i urge you to read dr. mercola â s research on splenda . i would not trust truvia either , nor would i true nu-stevia , which is made from corn.i have lots of green leaf stevia , but no longer use it , because the teas i buy are already sweet , and i â m fine with plain purified water and eating lots of fresh fruit . hence , i no longer crave extra sweetening agents.i nearly lost my vision from aspartame and don â t trust any artificial sweetener , as a result.mr. mercola is not a doctor.dr. mercola is an osteopathic physician . osteopaths are licensed to practice medicine in all 50 states and are recognized in sixty other countries , including all canadian provinces.http : / / www.aacom.org / about / osteomed / pages / default.aspxyou may not agree with some of his positions , but he is still a doctor.not everything causes cancer . but splenda was created to be a pesticide . however the â tester â misunderstood when told to â test â it . he thought he was told to â taste â it . and when tasting splenda , it was found to be sweet . hence , instead of being marketed to kill weeds , fungi , bacteria , or insects , it was labeled as an artificial sweetener . this according to research gathered by dr. mercola.not everything solely causes cancer . something may damage your immune system ( which i believe is 70 % of your gut ) , it may cause neurological damage and damage the brain and central or peripheral nervous system before it builds up enough in your body to actually cause cancer.this makes me wonder why you have come to dr. greger â s web site if you don â t care about your health in the first place.i don â t have cancer to my knowledge , but i have osteoporosis , which has serious consequences so i â m eating more healthy than ever before and am doing more weight bearing exercise.given how many artificial sweeteners made their way into the marketplace , i avoid them all together . splenda was originally created to be a pesticide , but when the tester was told to test it , he misunderstood and tasted it , found it to be sweet , and hence the product which was designed to kill or cause harm to pests , was created as an artificial sweetener.truvia has an equally sordid history.i have re-educated my taste buds by eating more nutrition fruit and occasionally adding small amounts dried fruit to sweeten beverages.rats are used as surrogates for humans . for example , and recent study bycriigen study links gm maize and roundup to premature death and cancer.http : / / sustainablepulse.com / 2012 / 09 / 19 / criigen-study-links-gm-maize-roundup-premature-death-cancer / # .ulsikhcl01othe variety of gmo maize ( corn ) used in this study has been deregulated and is in the marketplace ( grocery stores and supermarkets ) in the usa , and around the world . no peer reviewed safety testing has been published in the usa . the fda and usda have ignored the studies of this esteemed french research facility and the scientists who meticulously did the studies.for more about criigen , see : http : / / criigen.org / siteen / i no longer buy corn , since this sweet corn is grown in southeastern and northeastern u.s.a. and gmo corn and soy has been illegally planted in national wildlife refuges with the approval of the us government under the obama-monsanto administration so that the pollen would contaminate farms , fields , and backyard gardens throughout the country and continent.get involved . support the right to know about gmo â s in food . i contributed to the yes on 522 in washington state . hurry before there is no safe food to eat anywhere.i regularly use unflavored unsweetened almond milk in recipes . ideally i â d like to make my own ( amygdalate recipes date back to the 14th century le viandier de taillevent , where its the primary â milk â ) , but most often just use the prepared versions for convenience.for those who don â t care for the chalky taste added by calcium carbonate supplementation in the silk and almond breeze brands , the whole foods 360 private label uses tricalcium phosphate , which i find less objectionable in creamy soups.why not just make your own ! . go to â straight up foods.com â cathy fischer has recipes on her site for all non-dairy milks .. i have been making my own rice milk for a few years now â¦ brown rice and h20silk is one of the companies who contributed to give american citizens no right to know whether or not there food is genetically engineered to resist more toxic herbicides , such as round-up , dicamba or 2,4-d â the last know known to be contaminated with dioxins , the most toxic chemical every created by humankind and 2,4-d is an agent orange ingredient from the vietnam war . i drink purified water because don â t trust drinking products made by corporations who want to keep the public controlled and ignorant.all the nondairy milks we have available to us ( unless we make our own ) have vitamin a palmitate as an ingredient . shouldn â t we be avoiding vitamin a supplements ? i found in silk , only the unsweetened , original flavor contain no carrageenan . wish dr. greger would do a piece on this subject.i don â t know if this matters to you . but the corporation which makes silk , dean foods , inc . , contributed to the right ( not ) to know if genetically modified organisms are in their food . dean foods weighed in financially opposed to both states and the federal government â s labeling gmo â s in food.i take this as they have something to hide ! i realize that silk is sold as both organic and non-gmo , but it is not verified by the non-gmo project , to my knowledge.the usda has allowed some foods to contain some gmo â s , as well as synthetic ingredients . the usda has ignored the public in favor of big business on this stance as well as claiming carrageenan is safe because the fda said it was . they have ignored the health effects that people are experiencing . this to me is not surprising , given the revolving doors at the fda.numerous recent studies on gmo soy have uncovered very severe health damage to test animals , livestock , and humans . look at the severe birth defects as a result of ingesting gmo soy in danish pigs , and an infant in argentina at : http : / / gmoevidence.com / given the games played at the u.s. fda with monsanto â s michael taylor as food czar , and the coziness of the secretary of agriculture to monsanto , i have chosen to avoid all silk soy in particular , and all but eden organic soy in general.eden organic tests their soy beans to make certain they do not contain gmo â s . they are double certified organic , but not certified by the usda because the usda has undermined the rule of the law , the national organic foods and production act of 1990.with regards to carrageenan , the cornucopia institute has put out this report , â how a â natural â food additive is making us sick . â http : / / www.cornucopia.org / wp-content / uploads / 2013 / 02 / carrageenan-report1.pdfthey have tried to get the usda and fda to take carrageean out of organic food , but to no avail.our health is a political football putted back and forth between the usda and us fda , regardless of administration in the white house.could you please do a video on which dairy-free milk is healthiest ? what about the carageenan in commercially-prepared almond milk ? i have not been able to find any source for almond milk that does not contain this artificially altered seaweed derivative , other than my own kitchen.the wholefoods and traderjoes brand do not contain carageenan , but unfortunately they only sell them at their own stores . the wholefoods one is also organic.thank you , jesse _ grimes , i â ll have to check it out next time i am at whole foods . unfortunately , the nearest store is almost 2 hours away from me . in the meantime , i make my own almond milk at home and it is pretty tasty.my daughter bought a vita-mix blender which has a high speed motor and uses an polyester plastic jar which i find questionable . but , she makes her own almond milk with water that has been purified through ro and carbon filtration and raw â certified organic â almonds . the best almonds are those grown and produced by the organic method under the law , but the usda often does not follow the rule of the law.i too have a vita-mix and it works great for so many things . that â s awesome that you guys make your own too . i also wondered about the plastic container but when looking into it apparently it has too much power that it would crack any glass . makes sense i guess but would love to see it made of something different.i just looked at the ingredients list on my 2 favorite milk substitutes ( blue diamond vanilla almond breeze & pacific original hemp ) and noticed they both have vitamin a palmitate added to them . in another video dr. greger mentioned that vitamin a palmitate added to skim milk is suspected in weakening people â s bones . i wonder if there was any confirmation on that theory ? i have a question to ask about my loss of appetite . i have chronic pain from fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue . over the past 10 years i slowly lost my appetite for meat , fish , fast food , restaurant food and frozen foods . i pretty much live on just a few types of foods now . my typical daily meals consist of zero percent fat greek yogurt with cut up apples or grapes mixed in a couple times a day . i sometimes will have a bowl of organic shredded wheat with low fat organic milk with hemp hearts and flax on top . i really don â t eat much more then that except for fresh fruit . do you know what would cause this ? can medication ruin your appetite ? i don â t cook anymore because the smell bothers me unless it is apple pie or something i like . i am still about 20 lbs overweight and i â m not dieting . my bloodwork is normal except i am a bit iron deficient and my vitamin d is low and has been for years . i have never been able to donate blood because of my low iron . i take a vitamin daily . is what i am eating dangerous ? it is the only thing that appeals to me other then sweet things which i try and stay away from.commercial milk , almond or cow , is pasteurized â no enzymes â basically a non-food with heat-damaged minerals and vitamins , difficult for digestion and acid forming in the body . in fact your body will draw calcium from your bones to neutralise the acid and correct the ph to more alkaline ( osteoporosis ) . baby cow â s die when fed pasteurized cow â s milk . research dr tim o â shea / dr robert young for further information and stop drinking commercial milk â¦ and btw your commercial fruit juice organic or not , freshly squeezed or not is also pasteurized ! squeeze your own oranges at home and make your own nut milk from raw sprouted nuts and drink raw unpasteurized dairy from an organic source.also , read your labels to avoid the additive carrageenan . not all companies use the same ingredients . the silk brand is carrageenan free. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-carrageenan-safe / i couldn â t find vanilla in the ingredient list on the silk almond vanilla ( unsweented ) brand . just â natural flavors â whatever that means . - - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-394: should we take algae supplements for astaxanthin ? is any research available on astaxanthin which seems to be touted as a wonderful antioxidant ? markb / originally posted below dragon â s blood astaxanthin is the reason flamingos are pink ( or at least flamingos in the wild ; in the zoo they may be fed artificial dyes like farmed salmon â see my video artificial coloring in fish ) . astaxanthin is also the reason some crustacean shells turn red when boiled . one need not eat flamingo feathers or lobster exoskeletons , though . you can go right to the source and get it from green algae such as chlorella ( i recommend against blue-grean algae and spirulina â see for example my videos is blue-green algae good for you ? and another update on spirulina ) . a review last month suggests a wide range of beneficial effects , though one should note the author is listed as a dietary supplement industry consultant . with a few exceptions , i recommend against taking supplements as they have been found in some cases to be less effective ( see , for example , my produce not pills ) or even deleterious ( see is vitamin d the new vitamin e ? and my other 60 videos on supplements ) . one should take advice from health food store employees with a grain of himalayan pink salt : summarized in my blog health food store advice : often worthless or worst . â with a grain of himalayan pink salt â . funny ! : ) i take an astaxanthin supplement and i have noticed the brown age spots on my skin have lightened considerable and i don â t burn nearly as easily as i used to . the astaxanthin i take is an extract from an algae called haematococcus pluvialis.i â ve been taking astaxanthin for about six months . unlike the case with other supplements , astaxanthin proponents make a claim that is easily testable : . protection from sunburn . a couple months ago i was at laguna seca raceway watching the continental tire series challenge . it was a beautiful summer day so i decided to put it to the test . at 11 : 30 am i removed my shirt , exposing a 60 year old torso that hadn â t seen the light of day for more than a few minutes at a time for decades . i expected to have to cover up after about 20 minutes but , not seeing any sign of irritation , i kept going . i continued to check myself at frequent intervals . finally after two topless hours i called it quits . the next day i had no more than a pinkish hue . normally i â d have been peeling within a few days but it never happened . suffice to say i have continued taking astaxanthin.hello. would you recomend people to change their table salt for himalayan salt if they wanted to use salt ? or do you think normal salt has the same nutritional benefits as table salt.withc is the â better â option ? lots of lovethink a little further : i â m not an expert , but here is my understanding : enriched table salt has iodine added . many americans do not get enough iodine . so , if you are going to eat salt no matter what and you have a normal american diet , then you might as well eat normal iodine-enriched salt to make sure you get enough iodine.while himalayan or other specialty / sea salts have a lot of good press , what i have seen suggests that the extra minerals in those salts are a ) trivial and b ) inconsistent . so , you wouldn â t want to rely on those salts for a specific mineral.which leads to the real issue , in my opinion , and which i think you already know since you wrote â better â in quotes : neither is really all that good for you . arguing over which type of salt is better for you is like arguing whether maple syrup or sugar is better for you . or olive vs canola oil . the answer for all practical purposes is : neither because the differences are so minor in the big picture . with a healthy diet , you don â t need ( and you are better off without ! ) any table salt . or sugar / syrup . or oil.another way of looking at it is like this : suppose foods were rated on health scale form 0 being it has zero-value-what-so-ever ( and likely harms you short or long term ) and 100 being the best-food-ever . i don â t know what the actual numbers would be for table salt , sweeteners , and oils , but to argue the difference between different types is like arguing between a 2 and a 3 . i suppose you could make a legitimate arguement that one food is a 2 and the other food is a 3 . but is that worth the breath ? that â s just my 2 cents . i hope it helps . - - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-406: can hibiscus tea cause coughing ? an fyi . my mother used to take lasinopril ( sp ? ) for high blood pressure . it gave her a terrible dry cough and she quit taking it . then i read hibiscus tea was good for high blood pressure and bought her tea where hibiscus was the 2nd ingredient . then one day i found one where it was all hibiscus tea and bought that . it made her dry cough come back ( so the active ingredient in lasinopril must come from hibiscus ) . anyway , if you develop an unknown cough , it could be from the hibiscus tea. cbetter / originally posted on better than green tea ? the mechanism of action for the blood pressure lowering effect of hibiscus tea does appear to be the same ( at least in part ) as that very drug . both hibiscus and lisinopril act to inhibit an enzyme called ace . when our kidneys detect a drop in blood pressure they release an enzyme called renin into our bloodstream which converts a protein secreted by our liver into something called angiotensin-i which in our lungs is converted into angiotensin-ii by our angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) . that angiotensin ii then acts to constrict our arteries and boost our blood pressure â isn â t our body neat ? anyway , lisinopril ( and the anthocyanin phytonutrients that so brilliantly color hibiscus flowers ) inhibits ace , preventing the formation of angiotensin ii and subsequent rise in blood pressure . but that â s not all ace does ; it also degrades bradykinins , which can increase cough reflex sensitivity . so that â s the reason ace inhibiting drugs may cause coughing in up to a third of users and it makes sense that hibiscus could cause a similar reaction . plants can be powerful ! ( check out my video power plants ) . so there â s definitely science to back up your intuition cbetter â thanks so much for sharing ( and letting me geek out on physiology : ) . if she develops a chronic cough on hibiscus , she should stop drinking it . i talk about a diet-based approach to curing hypertension in my 2012 presentation uprooting the leading causes of death . thank you dr. greger . i have end stage copd . i went on a plant base diet 1 month ago . today , i am able to walk around my home . this is huge for me . i have basically been confined to bed for 2 years . i have been amazed as to how long i am able to stand , and move around . there really is something to this plant based program . i am still creating a complete program of cooking interesting foods . i have been able to stay on the program , so far . saw your article and decided to give it a try . my pulmonary dr is with unc health care , chapel hill , nc . his name is dr. james donohue , he knew of work being done , and some of the studies . i can â t wait to share all this with him . he is a fellow of the american college of chest physicians and a member of the american thoracic society , and the european respiratory society . he is a reviewer and writer for several journals including the american journal of respiratory and critical medicine , the new england journal of medicine , archives of internal medicine , the southern medicine journal , chest , and the journal of respiratory disease , anin addition , dr donohue served as a writer and reviewer for the medical knowledge self-assessment program in subspecialty of pulmonary and critical medicine for the american thoracic society and the aerican college of chest physicians . this teaching and research interest include sarcoid , interstitial lung diseases , copd , alpha-1 antitry deficiency , asthma . i have been very lucky to have his as a dr. and i can wait to share all i have been doing , in addition to him seeing me able to walk , stand , and talk without oxygen . to me it is totally amazing . i am hoping to brillant dr.s may someday talk and share the benefits of a plant based diet for others who are suffering and dying from copd . joan , sanford , ncthank you so much for sharing your story and please never hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything else i can do for you.i am a copd suffer too . can you share your diet plan here ? thanks.this is why nutritional science needs to be taught in schools ; from an early age.well said ! : ) should people on lisinopril limit their hibiscus tea intake ? i take lisinopril , am part of the 1 / 3 that seems subject to coughing episodes ( only occasionally ) . can i substitute the hibiscus tea to be my ace inhibitor and forget the lisinopril ? thanks so much for this site . terrific info , am passing it on as often as possible.how does one reduces pain from â shingles â . my aunt is 91 years of age and suffers from â shingles â . thanks for any advice . gerardi drank. i coughed. now i know why. thanks.is the coughing on hibiscus tea an issue other than annoyance ? i heard that coughing might be suppressed by eating dark chocolate , supposedly because it contains bromelaine . don â t know if there is any science to back it up though . - - -\n",

( 2010 ) paper is not just dried saffron . yes , they refer to 15mg per capsule , but in the preparation section of the article [ please email me ( hectoraceves1964 @ hotmail.com ) if you need an actual copy for educational purposes ] they indicate that this is an extract they are using ; but do not indicate the extract ratio . however , they used 120 grams of dried stigmas to obtain their total ( i guess ) extract . the study lasted 16 weeks ( 112 days ) . there were 23 patients in the control arm , taking 30mg / day . so each person took 3,360 mg in the study , leading to a total of 77.28 grams of extract used ( if my math is not wrong ! ) . so to obtain the same amount of active ingredients as in the study , one should take about 50mg of dried saffron per day . - - -\n",

            "Query PLAIN-456: is multivitamin use really associated to an increased risk of breast cancer ? i â m bit disappointed with your presentation , and i â m wondering why you exactly choose this multi vitamin study to underpin your conclusion in this video . the swedish cohort was from 2010 and in april of this year a meta-analysis , which is scientifically stronger in terms of proof , concluded : â multivitamin use is likely not associated with a significant increased or decreased risk of breast cancer , but these results highlight the need for more case-control studies or randomized controlled clinical trials to further examine this relationship . â [ â¦ ] louis / originally commented on multivitamin supplements and breast cancer thank you so much louis for taking the time to contribute ! it is such a relief to see that meta-analysis come out . this video was queued up from my volume 5 dvd , reviewing the peer-reviewed nutritional science published between spring 2010 to spring 2011 , and so i just missed it ( it wasn â t indexed by the national library of medicine until august 19 , 2011 ) . of course negative findings don â t automatically â cancel â out positive findings . as one of my research preceptors once quipped : â if two people drill for oil in texas and one finds oil and the other does not , one can â t conclude that the question of whether or not there is oil in texas remains undetermined . â similarly , the conclusion from the 2010 study profiled in the video is not necessarily invalidated : â these results suggest that multivitamin use is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer . this observed association is of concern and merits further investigation . â but it â s nice to know that if there is an effect it â s not one that has been replicated ! the critical question remains : should women take multivitamins or not ? that depends on the risks versus benefits like any other life decision . since both the risks and the benefits appear equivocal ( see for example the national institutes of health state-of-the-science conference statement on multivitamins , pdf here ) i agree with the cleveland clinic journal article i featured and would recommend women take the money they would have spent on the pills and instead buy some produce with more proven benefits ( see my breast cancer and diet post , for example ) . a similar recommendation can be made for men ( as a similar meta-analysis likewise thankfully casts doubt on the multivitamin link there as well ) . until we know more , i agree with the conclusion from the meta-analysis you cite : â until further studies assist in clarifying the association between multivitamin use and increased or decreased risk of breast cancer , health-care professionals should open discussions with their patients regarding multivitamin use and risk of breast cancer . â addendum : reported in today â s archives of internal medicine , a study from iowa women â s health study suggesting that multivitamin use may actually shorten women â s lives . to quote the editor : â because commonly used vitamin and mineral supplements have no known benefit on mortality rate and have been shown to confer risk â¦ .a better investment in health would be eating more fruits and vegetables â¦ â my personal philosophy ( developed not in a vacuum but informed by the overall â whole â of medical research i â ve read about in the last quarter century ) is pretty strongly in favor of what you suggest dr. greger â natural whole foods over human supplements ( or drugs , etc ) i rarely take anything other than b12 and vit d ( doctor prescribed ) for this reason , and prepare almost all my vegan meals from scratch . that having been said , there is a huge question that seems to be left unaddressed ( from what i can tell of the summaries here of both / all studies ) which stands out : mainstream vitamins with their large number of questionable ingredients ( fillers , coloring etc etc â i â m referring to all ingredients other than the vitamins themselves ; and even the vitamins may be a case of â not all are created equal â in quality ) versus vitamin pills that are not just vegan , but also have the least iffy ingredients . i â d like to see a study differentiate , or try to , between those two classes . then there is the issue of possible harmful effects of megadoses . combine those and ask this question : â mainstream chemicalized vitamins with megadoses , versus , vitamins with saner doses and with the least iffy ingredients ( in fillers , coloring , etc ) and the most natural sources of the vitamins / minerals â in a well desgined study , on ( yet another factor ) people who â ve used it long enough to be more likely a difference , say at least several years . i will not predict the latter will do as well or better than whole foods ( my guess is whole foods always win , except , when a medical condition specific to the person is such that focused / higher doses have more benefits than negative side effects ) but i wouldn â t be surprised if the latter type of vitamins / ingredients / doses do better than , or not as much harm as , the former type ( mainstream / lots of chemical additives / fillers / ingredients , some in megadoses , etc ) . have any researcher friends you could suggest this study to ? ; - ) if multivitamins and supplements aren â t regulated and may not even contain the labeled ingredients , how do we know which d3 and b12 vitamin to get ? i stay away from multivitamins but eat healthy , non processed foods , and take my favorite supplements , like amla , fenugreek . please do a video on adaptogens like aswagandha and maca , also my favorites that i recommend to my yoga students . you are my nutrition guru . keep it up ! - - -\n",
