ayakosushi,"I have been there a few times to the branch in Grenoble but I will not go back again. OK food good OK prices Bad service from seniors I don't like then the manager deals with as many customers at the same time. It seems a bit rude but I guess they don't see it that way. The manager was taking money from everywhere which makes them look greedy. It just feels like a factory in a rush to take money. The other staff seem OK but they seem to be very cold. I think for me is that the atmosphere is not what one would expect from a sushi restro. I did see one woman leave without ordering because they didn't seem to give her any attention after giving her the menu. It was clear that she needed help but the manager just was more interested in taking money. There is no rapport feeling with manager/ staff and customers. The waiting time is good but the food is nothing special at all. Adieu Also you need to update your opening and closing times on Google if you want money. It says you open at 10.30 on Sundays but in fact you open at 12 noon. You see I am not the only one who said that the Manageress is rude! Le service est détestable, la patron ne nous a mime pas rend notre ""Bonsoir"" et nous avons to publics pendant au coins 20 minutes une fois placés. C'est vraiment dommage, nous n'y pas! PAS du tout If you have a several Managers who are not polite, then how can you expect the staff to be any better? What will happen to your customers in a few years time?",restaurant good; good fresh; perfect usual; missing order; order time; good sushi; excellent quality; order ordering; sushi good; delicious fast,1

The sushi is good but don't break a duck's legs, I've seen better; on the other hand regarding the way in which they were rolled and tight it is more than average... They are half destroyed and the rice paper which surrounded some was not moistened enough so it remained too hard and complicated to eat.

As for the service, it is almost non-existent and mostly done by people who do not seem to be in the profession: order error, asahi beer exchanged for a kirin, the two teas ordered were reversed. Although the table is not very big, 3 times a young girl from the service passed by our table and looked at it but had no idea of ​​clearing away the piled up empty dishes.

Last time it was all the skewers from a mixed menu that were missing. On an 18 euro menu, that starts to add up to a lot. it's difficult to check directly on site because generally we place orders with several menus, and when there are 10 people waiting it's complicated to check with them, especially since they don't want to do it. And then, I really have the impression that they purposely forget things in the orders to save money. Because when we tell them: yes but last time you forgot this or that thing, they don't care at all. It's not bad but we're really going to start not going there anymore because of this.",restaurant good; good fresh; perfect usual; missing order; order time; good sushi; excellent quality; order ordering; sushi good; delicious fast,2

But the choice of drink is not the right one because we ask for a beer (draught) and it certainly seems to cost too much for a commercial gesture. We decide to pay it, i.e. €7 for 2 beers and a wait which is not our fault and an order for more than €100. Yes the meal was good, yes we saw that the error was taken seriously, but offering two beers worth €2.50 cost price for a basket at more than €100 for an error not being From our side, we are disappointed with the commercial sense of this company and find it a shame.",restaurant good; good fresh; perfect usual; missing order; order time; good sushi; excellent quality; order ordering; sushi good; delicious fast,2

ayakosushi,"Reviews of the Grenoble Barracks restaurant from for many years. The food is still good but the service has greatly deteriorated. Today, I arrive 10 minutes early to pick up an order made with the app. The gentleman barely looks at me and tells me curly it’s for noon. Ok, I pay and wait for noon, already cooled by the horrible welcome. I'll be back at noon sharp. And then they ignore me, put other customers in front of me. After 7 minutes of standing like a stake, the same person comes back to me and tells me your order is here. The same bag that had been waiting on the counter since I arrived. I point out to him that noon is well past and then he yells at me without letting me speak and he tells me that next time, there's no point in ordering from him again.

I question myself and tell him that I am going to carry out a careful inventory of my order. After carrying out this inventory as a family (I remind you that it is my daughter's birthday, another spoiled pleasure!), the order turns out to be incomplete! I call the restaurant back and ask to speak to the manager. I was once again asked to be the assistant. I refuse and definitively end the ayano Sushi experience. I tell myself that even by having a personalized treatment ayano Sushi does not even satisfy the simple satisfaction of a complete order.

ayakosushi,"ayano Sushi is clearly above the rest of other Japanese restaurant chains in terms of quality, atmosphere and service. The one in is particularly pleasant, extremely attentive staff, with behavior worthy of a restaurant and certainly not a fast food restaurant or a low-end Asian cuisine restaurant. However, I regret that since its creation, the menu has never changed. I have already looked around the menu more than once and the menus offered are starting to bore me. I would like new combinations, even new products. The online ordering service is always fast and efficient, there are rarely any delays, the dishes are well presented, even takeaway doesn't look ""cheap"". I like it a little less when they exchange the cardboard pots for plastic pots (for hot products in particular). The loyalty card is also very interesting.

Points to improve : Slightly “cheap” decor and elements: disposable plastic apron for example. The table is not a real kitchen counter and is therefore too low: fortunately the course does not last long. The kitchen itself is just a sink + hob: we are far from the restaurant... And above all: we do not provide participants with a recipe, under the pretext that it can be found on the website. However, on the internet the recipe is much too brief (only the rice recipe). In summary: if you want to learn how to make sushi, which is simple and quick, the service meets this need without it costing very much.

The advisor insisted I select which price option I wanted before proceeding; despite me explaining I was not able to commit until I knew a cot bed can be added. He then said I am not prepared to get authorisation unless you are prepared to book! Well I’m sorry I am not being pressured or spoken to like that. I am a customer and felt belittled by that response. If I don’t feel comfortable or falling informed of the I cannot book.

The following day both me and my dad phoned the hotel inquiring whether our rooms were still confirmed. We spoke to a french man who confirmed, yes, everything is fine, both rooms are confirmed. So the day arrived and we set out on our 2 and a half hour journey to Cardiff. On arrival we were met by a french man at reception and we produced all our confirmation documents, to the absolute shock, both rooms were cancelled and if we wanted to re-book them, then we have to pay again at an increased price to what we originally paid. We understandably were not happy and asked to speak to the manager,however the person we was speaking to, the person that we had been arguing with for the last half hour, was in fact the manager and the same person which we had previously spoke to on the phone confirming our rooms were booked. We asked him several questions in regards to: why didn’t the hotel contact us when the rooms were cancelled? Why, when both me and my dad phoned the hotel, did you say both rooms were confirmed? ( to which we found out the one room had already been cancelled prior to us phoning up!!),to which he had very little response, In fact, the only response he had , pay again or leave!!

After explaining that it's the baskets I ordered that I want, we asked him to come back 3 hours later to collect them. I finally tell myself everything is fine. But when I unpack my items, I have the unpleasant surprise to notice that the cold meat/cheese surprise breads have transformed into fish surprise breads. However, on the boxes it was clearly marked cold meats/cheese. Needless to say, no one wanted it and I just had to throw it all away.

Nothing received, despite various reminders via their site. Furthermore, while when I responded to this email 3 weeks ago I had a response, since then, the company has no longer given any sign of life: 0 returns to emails, 0 returns on messages left online, support service permanently marked ""away"" for online help in the form of chat, standard permanently on ""our operators are all busy, please leave a message"", without anyone ever calling back...The company being a subsidiary of private sales, the idea that it closed overnight after having raked in, via the ""black Friday"" offer, a maximum of ""customers"", seems quite strange, but the absence of any response to complaints, while my past experience was that she was rather reactive, makes me fear that she has actually gone out of business",book recommend; email don; reservation disappointed; weeks company; confirm reservations; restaurants service; restaurants great; great shame; make restaurant; restaurants card,1

This was done by corporate staff, management and hourly employees. Name calling and insulting comments.They don't do anything in regards to no calls or no shows.

But then they get upset that the store labor is too high.They hire in new people to become management. Much of the corporate staff didn't work for Cottage Inn before starting at the corporate office. They don't want to promote elderly employees. They openly admit you will never be promoted. They hire in younger employees at higher wages. Many of them have no experience. They expect the veterans to train them but there are no rewards. Then the majority of the new hires don't last very long. They spend most of their time on their phones.

Gemini,"Welcome Switch fans, to the long awaited next installment in the Reggie Reviews series. Today I am reviewing The Gemini Restaurant in Paris, France! The story goes that I and the rest of my Nintendo of America colleagues had just finished up a very exciting business conference with our friends over at Nintendo of Europe. After wrap up, we decided to take a small tour around the lovely city of Paris. I, of course, took note of all of the similarities between the real Paris and the version seen in the Mario part Tour mobile game. I have to say, Nintendo hits it out of the park once again.We then decided to stop inside the Gemini, since that seemed to be the only restaurant name that I could pronounce. I decided to order the Truffle Pizza, and since I am from New York, I love a good pizza. The first bite and it was already heaven on earth! Truly authentic French food being served at this wonderful establishment. I am also very glad that the waiters entertained my shenanigans when asking them what they thought about Mother 3. I had a good laugh after they didn't even know what I was talking about. Excellent service, great food, and an overall fantastic time for any Nintendo fan wanting to stop in and admire the beautiful jungles of France.Also, don't forget to check out himin 4, which lands in stores July 21st.

Angelina,"When my husband and I did our European vacation this past September, Paris was our last stop. My only request was 3 thing. to see the Eiffel Tower, Visit the Versailles and have a brunch at this marvelous brunch place called Angelina :) That morning was so rainy but it did not let my spirit stop us from trying the famous hot chocolate (thank you tiptoe lol) we went there early, I think they open at 8 am on a Thursday we were there by 8:15? I already expect that there will be a long line but lo and behold there was no line!!! it was meant to be! (but to be honest probably it was the rain) we were greeted when we enter the restaurant and got seated right away. The ambiance on the restaurant was definitely amazing and so Parisian! there was a lot of people already seated and for them being open just 15 minutes just tells you this is the place to go.as we were looking at the menu my husband and I decided to order the brunch tower? (I'm sorry I couldn't remember the actual name of it) but this menu came with everything from drinks, tower of assorted pastries, breakfast sandwich and it was a dream! everything was pretty amazing! the presentation and the taste was really really good and too bad we couldn't eat the whole thing. to be honest my husband and I can just share that brunch tower and I think we will be okay because it was just too much but for the price you pay it was definitely worth it! we did splurged because YOLO.Service was surprisingly very good! I said surprising because we are in Europe and don't expect great service but Angelina is all about their food and service, they are on point and quick and they make sure you are well taken care off!I highly recommend Angelina as a stop when you are in Paris. just make sure you are here early.",items french; im outside; expect service; chocolate breakfast; expect service; hot chocolate; cream did; expect service; just brunch; say experience,5

Angelina,"I kept hearing about Angelina when looking up things to do in Paris, so I figured I should try it at least once. It was good but not amazing, though worth trying once so you can check it off your Paris list.My friend and I woke up super early due to jet lag, so we decided to come for an early breakfast before hitting up the Louvre. I'm glad we did, since there was already a long line of people when we left at 9:30 am!We came on a Friday morning around 8:40 and snagged one of the last open tables. The main seating area is a in a big room with all the tables close together, while we were in a smaller room in the back. Even though it was packed in the main room, it was also super quiet when we walked in. I guess everyone was focused on eating and not chatting.It was early, so we opted to share their Parisian breakfast ($23), which comes with your choice of tea, coffee, OR hot chocolate, fresh fruit juice, croissant and pan au chocolat, and a baguette. I also ordered a vanilla pastry ($10.50) on the side.The hot chocolate is what they're known for, so we chose that. Just make sure you know what you're getting in for; it's quite thick and rich. When you're drinking it, it's feels like you're drinking straight up melted chocolate more than anything else. My friend took one sip and was done, while I slowly sipped away at it until I finished. I enjoyed it, but it was a little too rich and sweet for me at 9 am.The rest of the items in the breakfast set was okay, nothing out of the ordinary.I loved the vanilla and thought the cream inside was very light and went perfectly with the crispy layers, which tasted vaguely of hazelnut. The is what pushes my rating of this place from 3 to 4 stars.After dining here, you can visit the bakery at the front of the restaurant to pick up some more items to go. Their pastries looked bomb, but I was too sugared out to consider buying any.Service here is quite slow. It took a while for the servers to come take our order and give us the check, though food comes out quickly after you order.",items french; im outside; expect service; chocolate breakfast; expect service; hot chocolate; cream did; expect service; just brunch; say experience,4

The dining room is pretty, but the service was not friendly... at least I felt that way.I ordered their hot chocolate because I have heard so much about it. I drank a few sips and never finished it.

Angelina,"I dine at the renowned restaurant Angelina and I must say, it was quite an experience. While there were a few highlights worth mentioning, I must admit that I was not entirely impressed with my visit.Let's start with the positive aspects. The breakfast at Angelina was undeniably great. The menu offered a wide variety of options, from classic dishes to more innovative creations. The quality of the ingredients was evident in every bite, and the flavors were well-balanced. I particularly enjoyed their freshly baked pastries, which were simply delightful.Moving on to the food, I must say it was good, but not exceptional. The dishes were well-prepared and presented beautifully, but they lacked that wow factor that one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. While the flavors were decent, they didn't leave a lasting impression. It felt like a missed opportunity to truly showcase the richness and complexity of French cuisine.Now, let's talk about the service, which was undoubtedly the highlight of my visit. The staff at Angelina was simply amazing. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant dining experience.Despite the great breakfast and amazing service, I must say that my overall experience at Angelina fell short of my expectations. While the food was good, it lacked that extra touch to make it truly memorable. Considering the reputation and price point of this establishment, I was hoping for a more exceptional dining experience.",items french; im outside; expect service; chocolate breakfast; expect service; hot chocolate; cream did; expect service; just brunch; say experience,3

There were two lovely waiters, very friendly, very accommodating.Started with a Kir royals, and the escargot. The kids got the French onion soup--the snails were drenched in garlic butter and delicious. My kids tried the escargots--first time ever, and both declared them to be quite tasty. My son ordered the steak--very tender, perfectly cooked--a little more towards rare than medium rare, and nicely seasoned. The vegetable terrine was not to his liking, but I thought they tasted great--layers of vegetables like creamed sweet potato and zucchini and eggplant. My daughter ordered salmon and spaghetti in squid ink--she enjoyed it immensely. I had what I thought was the best of all three-medallions of duck breast, cooked perfectly and centered over purged sweet potatoes.Lovely, leisurely dinner followed by dessert.

I made a reservation online a few weeks ago and don't think I even needed it as it was early and the restaurant was empty upon my arrival (a little after 9am) I was seated immediately and ordered the best pain au chocolat that I had during my stay in Paris. It was warm and super flaky and just delicious. I also had a cappuccino followed by the Sweet martine breakfast. Had I not gone through the bread basket too, I would have ordered something else to try because everything here was that good. The martine was roasted and mashed sweet potato topped with avocado, creamy goat cheese, chickpeas and what I think was pesto? It was amazing! It also came with soft boiled scrambled eggs and a side salad which was perfect as I've barely had any greens during my time in Paris. I wish I had more time in Paris because I would have come back again for breakfast but if I am ever in Paris again, I would most definitely come back to Le Corner!

Odette,"In town for the last stage of Le Tour, and wanted a top notch dinner while here. This was recommended by UBS, 2 Michelin stars. Had to hoof it over after the stage ended; many streets were closed ... stopped at a nearby brasserie to change clothes in the bathroom lol.Totally worth the effort. Started with a delicious wine and a Negroni; they came with two complementary cheese puffs. So light, deep cheese flavor, crusty outside ... aime asked for another two for dessert. This was followed by the beef tartare and pea target with smoked burrata. The tartare was sublime; and the picketed rhubarb with it was a perfect match. The target was a great counterpoint to the tartare; so delicate, mix of flavors, freshest peas. I had the prawns and mushrooms, which was very good; aime had the Parmesan gnocchi; cooked perfectly, deep flavors in the Parmesan sauce, which included pomegranate seeds.Service was outstanding; corked the remainder of our wine to go. The ambiance was very calming; although there was a family there in sneakers and baseball caps. The wall had a very interesting wood pattern, which mimicked waves in 3D. Only thing I would change is the door to the hotel lobby; people kept coming in to look, and the elevator was right there.Top recommendation.

Just be sure to plan accordingly and factor in the wait time.

We laughed off the freezing temperatures, but it's worth considering if you're not a fan of cold weather.Menu Variety:I decided to go all out and sampled a few things- the falafel, shawarma, and, of course, the fries. The food met my expectations. I was happy to discover that they don't settle for commercially available fries. The extra effort was evident in the taste.Return Factor:Despite the lengthy wait, I'm inclined to give L'As du falafel another shot on my next visit to Paris.

The falafel is so fresh and flavorful, and the bread is so soft and warm. The sauces they add accompanied with the fresh crunchy veggies are so good. Every bite is perfect... I like to add the marissa sauce they have at the table to my sandwich and kick it up a notch. The fries are fresh and crispy! I add the marissa sauce to those, too. They also make a mint lemonade, which is too good to pass up. We had a chance to try the meatball shakshuka, and it was delicious as well.The service is friendly and they speak English too!

L'As du Fallafel,"This place is good but not sure it lives up to the hype. The pita sandwiches are good but not the best I've had.My friend and I were staying at a hotel not too far from here, so for an easy dinner our first night in Paris, we decided to give L'As du falafel a try.Please note they have two lines: a takeout line on the left and a dine-in line on the right. We came by a little before 9:30 am on a Thursday evening and there was a short wait of a few minutes to get seated. The restaurant is pretty large with plenty of seating, so even with long lines during the day I assume it moves pretty quickly.Half of the menu is in French and the other half is in English, which made it easy to order.We shared a half sweet potato appetizer ($8) and got our own pita sandwich. My friend got their famous falafel pita for $12, and I got the shawarma pita with turkey and lamb for $16.The sweet potato appetizer was really good. Probably the biggest half sweet potato I've ever seen! And it was roasted perfectly.The shawarma pita was solid but not good as I would've expected. My friend thought the same for his falafel pita.First of all, it's messy to eat! I recommend dining in if you're planning to get a pita sandwich, and if you're planning to do takeout, eat it at home (or your hotel). I was making a mess while eating, and that was with the help of a fork. Portions are huge and we were struggling to finish the last couple bites.I didn't like how the yogurt sauce, which was delicious, was only added to the top of the pita sandwich. After I was halfway into the pita sandwich, there was no more sauce in the middle and I was sad.For the schawarma, I personally found the meat a bit on the dry side and bland. I had to add a little bit of salt to make it flavorful enough for my taste buds.I tried a bite of my friend's falafel pita, and while I think the falafel was really good, I don't think it's the best falafel I've ever had.Service was quick and someone's usually keeping an eye on your area to make sure everyone's good.",hype food; falafel line; line takeaway; hype food; hype food; hype food; pita good; wait falafel; falafel good; line place,4

I've had this place on my radar for years (I don't even know from where) and now that I was finally visiting Paris, I was able to give this place a try.We got there at around 5:30 on a Sunday. There's one line for takeaway and one for dine in. We decided to do takeaway. Don't let the line intimidate you. It's worth the wait and we only ended up waiting about 15 minutes. These guys have their ducks in a row. One person goes down the line taking orders/collecting payments. Then when you get up to the window, you give them your ticket and they make your order fresh. We ordered the falafel special sandwich to share, since we were still planning on having dinner later. This might be the best falafel I've ever had. It's freshly fried, so it comes out hot and crispy. I believe 6 falafel come in a sandwich. It also comes with all the fix-ins: lettuce, tomato, eggplant, some kind of red cabbage slaw that really balances out the whole sandwich, hummus, and garlic sauce. It's pretty messy to eat but it's so good. My only piece of feedback would be for them to layer the sauce/hummus. It just sits on top so when you get towards the middle/bottom, you don't get any of those flavors anymore.I wish we got to try the shawarma.

Victoires,"Found this place while walking to a nearby restaurant to get lunch. It was raining lightly but people were waiting in line. Thought to myself that it must be good.Couple of days later, I went and was seated right away. Started with Mojito cocktail and ordered half carafe of red and white wine each. Was glad my server spoke English. Ordered the French Onion Soup, escargot, duck confit, beef tartar and side of salad. The food was great, no fancy presentation but delicious.The place is little compact but the price and the food was worth it.

A spot that I could recommend and go back to again the next time I'm in the area. 11/10.",paris place; food just; day onion; food just; cozy staff; food good; good steak; salad just; food just; food ordered,5
Victoires,"Our last meal in Paris.This place was packed when we came here, and luckily they were able to fit two people in without a reservation. We had to sit in the back and was crowded against other tables, but it was fine since we didn't need to wait.The reason we came here, was for the duck confit.... but unfortunately they were sold out by the time we came by. We opted for the steak and fries and the beef tartare and fries inside. We also got the french onion soup as an appetizer.Service was quick. and the food was very tasty and simple. It wasn't expensive at all, which explains why this place was packed in the first place.Interestingly, they provide ketchup and mayo for each table... i wonder if that means they know a lot of americans come here. youwill come back again when i'm back in Paris.",paris place; food just; day onion; food just; cozy staff; food good; good steak; salad just; food just; food ordered,4

The steak-frites are good but chewy, featuring a slab of topped with a smoking sprig of thyme. The duck was a bit dry and the beer helped to digest it. The French onion soup not worth the calories. Lack of salt and tasteless cheese barely melted broke our hearts. The wines by the glass can be rough, but the authentic buzz should make up for any flaws.Cheers!",paris place; food just; day onion; food just; cozy staff; food good; good steak; salad just; food just; food ordered,2

I ordered Creme brulee for dessert, it was okay, it had just the slightest hint of cigarette flavor which was unfortunate.The staff was really friendly and the service fast and efficient and the prices very reasonable.

Victoires,"In my opinion, this is one of my favorite eats in Paris. We came around dinner time and they were very crowded. Even though there were 3 parties ahead of us, we only waited for around 10 minutes.The space inside is a tight and it was very busy when we went. We ordered the escargot and the steak. The escargot was exceptional! Very tender and the garlic parsley butter was to die for. The steak frites was also very delicious. Although, I ordered the steak medium and it came out raw in the middle. They immediately sent it back without hesitation and apologized for the mistake and they got it right the second time around. I also ordered a creme brulee which came out bigger than your usual creme brûlée. It was probably my favorite dish of the night. So good I ordered another. Overall, the food was really good considering the average price of things here was around 14 euros.The service is pretty good considering how crowded the restaurant is, our waiter was pretty new but he was still knowledgeable and attentive nonetheless.y only problem with this place is the wait time. Yes, we went when it was pretty busy, but waiting around 35 mins for our first dishes to come out got a bit tiring.Overall, I would highly recommend this place as the food is delicious, the service is decent, and the price is really good!",paris place; food just; day onion; food just; cozy staff; food good; good steak; salad just; food just; food ordered,4

It looked huge for a tartar + froi-gra salad.No hurry, n' it was just so pleasant...

Victoires,"Whenever in Paris, we come to victories a couple times and here's why:Wait time- Most of the time we get seated right away even though the restaurant is always busy. They are quick!!Price- Very affordable.Food- Good food! Their duck confit is very delicious and highly recommended. The skin is crunchy and the duck meat is flavorful and well seasoned. This is the dish I can eat every week and will not get tired of it. Steak tartare comes in second. It's a classic dish and they deliver. We always finish each meal with a plate of cheese and honey. This may not sound very appealing to some but it is really good. Their escargot is average, the snails are a bit small and they are lost in the butter parsley sauce.Overall this place is a solid choice.",paris place; food just; day onion; food just; cozy staff; food good; good steak; salad just; food just; food ordered,4

So I played your stay a bit till 7:30 before the show start. Cos it's cold outside and I don't have anywhere to go anyways.So I opened the laptop to reply on some emails. bow there's another lady siting beside me worked for hours here ordered just coffee and not get kick out.But the waiter later told me that the restaurant is full reservation and I should leave in 10 mins. However the restaurant is still having quite a lot seats !!!I don't see why this is only to me . Maybe because I'm Asian ?

Bistrot Richelieu,"My friend and I stopped by for lunch on Friday at 1 am and the restaurant was about half full. I had a reservation, but don't think I needed it.To start, my friend got a beer and I got a glass of one of their white wines. Both were good.In addition to the regular menu offerings, they also offer some daily menu items. I went with the frog leg appetizer ($19.90) off the daily menu and the duck confit ($21.90) from the regular menu for my entree.The frog legs were cooked with parsley and butter. I haven't had them in a long time, but I liked the ones here after adding some salt. For the duck confit, it was okay as well, but I did find it a bit on the dry side.My friend got the chicken breast with ratatouille ($20.90) and really liked it. I tried a bite of both and agree that the chicken and ratatouille were incredibly flavorful. I chose to come to this restaurant because it came up in my research for a good ratatouille spot, and I'm glad it didn't disappoint on that regard!",food return; great steak; ordered come; menu got; food eat; good ok; food eat; place good; little wonderful; ordered restaurant,4

L'Escargot,"Took awhile to get here, from Av. des Champs-Elysees.We missed our 4pm reservation yesterday, due to delayed flights, we opted for another scheduled cruise reservation on the Seine .While waiting for the next available tables outside the restaurant, we met a family from ny as well. Chatted between English, Mandarin and Cantonese.There were 2 girl couples ahead of us. The 2nd couple left about 15 minutes of waiting, and the 1st couple who is Chinese left a few minutes later. They claimed to have waited over an hour and a half already .I guess this turn of events benefited us. We waited another 5 minutes and got seated .There were so many Mandarin speaking Chinese in the restaurant . Our next tables sat 2 young men who work for Huiwei, one has been in Paris for 12 years, the other visiting Paris via Amsterdam and Dussdorf, Germany. We had some great conversations.The place where we were seated was cramped, didn't see the rest of the restaurant, so it was hard to comment on the facility. It was pretty dark by the time we got there around 6pm.Food was excellent, priced very reasonable. The Escargot, frog legs, foie gras, sweetbread, ended with crime brûlée, all highly recommended, from multiple reviews that I gleaned through online. Service was excellent. No compliant there.

L'Escargot,"This was literally the first restaurant we headed to after dropping our luggages off in our hotel room. Unfortunately, this place isn't all that good as its namesake dish is bland.We ordered the following:6 large escargot - €28 - They were not noticeably bigger and they were bland. The flavor came from the garlic parsley sauce, but there wasn't much of that.Frog legs (Cuissies de grenouilles) - €17 - This was their best dish, flavorful, tender meat.Ribeye (Entrecôte) - €32 - This was also another miss. It wasn't tender, it was also bland, I needed to spread the herb butter on to every piece of the chewy steak and we didn't even bother to finish it towards the end.If you have this restaurant on your ""to try"" list, maybe shuffle it to the bottom of the list.

L'Escargot,"Was expecting more from this place given that it's a super popular restaurant, but I was a bit disappointed by my meal on both the service and food front, especially since it's a pricker spot.I came by for a late lunch with my friend on Saturday around 2:45 and there was a short wait of maybe 10 minutes. Luckily it wasn't too long.There's patio seating as well as indoor seating. Indoors the decoration is very old school, and the servers are dressed up in suits to reflect the more formal dining environment.The menu has plenty of escargot options as well as many classic French dishes. I wanted to try both foie gras and escargot, and L'Escargot happens escargot cooked with foie gras, so I got that ($18 for 6). For my main, I got the lamb shank for $42.First of all, it took a while for the server to stop by our table to take my order, and even longer for the food to arrive. I was starving given the late lunch hour, so that didn't help.When the food finally did arrive, I was surprised to see something other than lamb shank for my main. We asked one of the servers, and she confirmed they had given me the wrong order and took the sweetbread away. It was another 10 minute wait for my lamb shank =/I also wasn't sure if they had messed up my escargot order, so I was trying to ask someone while waiting for the lamb, but our server was nowhere in sight and it took a couple minutes before we could get his attention. He confirmed that it was the escargot with foie gras, but since I didn't taste any foie gras, I'm not convinced that's what I got.The escargot was underwhelming and bland, and like I mentioned earlier, I didn't taste the foie gras. I had to add salt to each piece to make it more palatable.The lamb shank was better but overall it was just okay. Not worth the $42 I paid for it.When the check came, I was surprised that they charged $10 for a bottle of still water. That was the cherry on top of an already overpriced and memorable meal. Our server didn't mention anything about the cost when we ordered the still water. I wish he would have, otherwise we wouldn't have gotten it.I also thought he might take something off for giving me the wrong entree, but to my surprise they charged me for everything.",escargot foie; restaurant good; service touristy; service touristy; restaurant minutes; service touristy; service touristy; escargot recommend; service touristy; date english,3

They had a great lunch deal with two courses for E 19.5. My buddy started out with a salad and had salmon as a main course. I had an excellent order of escargot followed by a surprisingly good order of steak frites. The ladies ordered a vegetarian dish off of the regular menu and were pleased.

We ordered the traditional, the chili and the foie gras - all were incredible. The frog legs were a huge appetizer, so definitely a good one to share. Same with the foie gras; they did not skimp. The beef tartare appetizer is the only one we would skip; we love beef tartare but thought the texture was a bit too soft. Our waiter suggested the fried chanterelles, which were flavorful but the egg on top was a bit overcooked. For main courses, we got the duck breast pie (delicious) and the sweetbreads which were served with the most amazing potatoes I've ever had. Highly recommend!

This was the first restaurant that popped up that met our interests, and we couldn't have been happier to discover it.All the servers spoke English, making us feeling comfortable, and they were all very kind & attentive as well. We were seated upstairs, and I'm not sure, but my date and I theorized all the English speaking guests were placed up there. Not that it was an issue, in fact, we were grateful for how private and quiet it was compared to downstairs.The food was mouth-watering, with my personal favorite being the mashed potatoes and my date's being the sweetbread. We like to share our meals, so I got a taste of all kinds of things on the menu, including the frog legs like I hoped for, french onion soup, sea bream, and of course, the famous escargot.We were so impressed that despite our full bellies, we still ordered dessert- a creme brulee & an eclair- both excellent choices to end the evening with.

Les Artizans,"My husband and I went here on our last night in Paris, at the recommendation of our concierge. We were looking for something that 1) wouldn't be booked out same day, 2) would be around €30-40pp including drinks, 3) was walking distance from our hotel, and 4) was casual yet nice enough to dress up for if we felt like it. Our concierge immediately thought of this place and told us about it as if it were his own secret. It was obvious that he personally loved it.An hour later, we walked in and were already excited. The ambiance was perfect and exactly what we were hoping for. It's cozy & hip, rustic & modern all in one. The service was warm, friendly and personal; we ordered a ""pot"" of wine, one set meal (le menu carte), and one plat total, all to share... which I think is perfect portion-wise for two people.Y'all. I am completely shocked that no one has reviewed the food/dinner here (see Google for more reviews). It was INCREDIBLE. Truly some of the best food we've ever had. For our entree (appetizer) we ordered the veal's head with escargots. Mind-blowing. Left me speechless. Our main courses were the lamb shoulder confit and the semi-cooked sirloin. Again, both were delicious and truly exceptional. The only thing not over-the-top-incredible was, funny enough, the dessert--though still very good, the cheesecake with rice/speculoos crust wasn't something I would pick again.We both left so happy and saying to each other that we would 100% return the next time we come to Paris... and probably order the exact same things .

The toasted bread was served with jam and a piece of foie gras, the jam relieved the greatness of the foie gras and was rich and very flavorful.We also ordered oysters, there are several varieties to choose from, we are N3 utah beach, up store front stall freshly opened (p6)Desserts are not recommended and we didn't order the beef baked in red wine which some people said was a step down.The two of us these + two drinks nearly 140 euros, eat very full.Address: 13 Rue du Bac, 75007 to make a reservation!

We did make a reservation but when we arrived around 11am it was not busy at all. By the time it was 12pm it did get packed so if you are coming during that time make sure you have a reservation!",paris time; palette bacon; great style; cheese sausage; got good; crepe start; really nice; crepes got; crepes got; crepes paris,5
BREIZH Café Montorgueil | La Crêpe Autrement,This was one of the best meals we had in Paris! They do take reservations online which is a good idea because they were busy! The servers were very friendly and had a tag team operation going on that seemed very efficient and effective. I believe they have menus in French and English if your French isn't great. Cool selection of riders and the one we ordered was great with everything we ate. They have buckwheat style crepes and palettes in the style of Normandy which are delicious. The special I had was great and gorgeously presented and we love love loved the Japanese style dessert crepe as well.,paris time; palette bacon; great style; cheese sausage; got good; crepe start; really nice; crepes got; crepes got; crepes paris,5

La Cordonnerie,"First thanks for reading my paris adventure and vote for my review if you find this helpful..I love my airing so much because the area I was in had all the best and popular spots. I could just walk and saved me lots of time from traveling back and forth..So this place I did a walk in with out reservation. They literally had the last table available, so I got lucky. I love the open kitchen concept where the chef is cooking away. He interact with the customers as he is cooking. What a wonderful experience. The one server whose running around as fast he could to serve all of us. That server was friendly and I loved his welcomed vibe and attitude. This place remind me of welcoming a friend to their home cooked meal..It was casual fancy and I did a 2 appetizers and one main meal with 2 glasses of wine to pair with. I had a white and red..Steak frites - I got the shallot sauce with red wine instead of the black pepper sauce. I wanted something different. The sauce was ok. It wasn't like a wow. I do love the nice touch of generous amount of grilled translucent onions on top of the steak. The steak was good but chewy on the ends. Maybe if I got the black pepper sauce it will make a difference..Overall I loved the service. The friendly server was working his arse off. He deserved a raise. The chef as well one person only to cook everything was fantastic. I love this spot and will come support again next time I'm in paris. My bill came up to like 50 euros which is amazing for the amount of stuff I got. Just the experience alone was amazing! Thanks for reading and have a day..Crispy pork - om whatever this was it was amazing. It reminded me of a crispy egg roll wrap filled with pork in it. The pork is shredded and had a wonderful flavor of spices and maybe some red wine in it because it was a dark burgundy color. Went really well with a glass of white wine..Spicy oyster mushrooms - had a nice touch of curry with it. It was light and went well with my white wine.",10 good; wait reservation; restaurant come; chef right; service small; wait reservation; chef good; wine love; wait reservation; restaurant food,4

This is not a restaurant where you want to rush through your meal since dining here is more than just the food, it is an experience that, like the food and wine, should be savored.We tell all our friends who come to Paris to come to La and I would not pass up a chance to come here at least once every time I come to Paris.",10 good; wait reservation; restaurant come; chef right; service small; wait reservation; chef good; wine love; wait reservation; restaurant food,5

The escargot was super flavorful and tasty. I got the burger, which was solid, however the bun did come pretty burnt.

I needed to find a lunch spot next to the Louvre but was worried I would have to settle for a tourist trap.This spot although just a few minutes from the Louvre gave me that true Paris meal experience during my 1 day in the city that I almost didn't dare to hope for.

Le Relais du Louvre,"Le relays du Louvre is a small, casual brasserie not far, as its name suggests, from the Louvre. Its interior is an all wood affair giving it a cosy, warm ambiance. There are a row of ridiculously small tables lined across one of the outer walls of the restaurant for those who want to sit outside. It was raining on the day we visited, putting an end to any thought of that madness.With the exception of their burgers, the menu is mostly French, and includes omelettes, crepes, a full section of salads, in addition to other French specialities. I order the Confit de curse de Canard, which translates to Preserved Leg of Duck. It was superb. Perhaps the best I have ever had. The American in our group resisted our taunting and ordered...yup, a cheeseburger. And you know what? She was surprisingly happy with it.My daughter, however, was not at all happy with her cheese crepe, finding the crepe itself too bland, and the cheese to sharp. That said, she is a super finicky eater, whose benchmark of all things French is Paul in Dubai. My wife ordered a giant salad topped with smoked salmon and loved every bit of it.Service was excellent. If you are at the Louvre, rather than wasting your time and money at those horrible touristy places littered across the backstreets of the museum, make your way straight to this little brasserie where you will be treated to an excellent French meal.Waste NOT.

Baltard au Louvre,"Was excited to try this place as we walked past it a couple times earlier in the week and checked out the menu. There were a couple dishes we were interested in giving a go. Well the food I'd give mixed reviews to. I had a risotto and it was overly salty and heavy on the garlic. My husband had the beef bourguignon, I snuck a sample and it was delish. They were out of many of the deserts that we were interested in trying, but had a chocolate mousse with raspberry desert. That dish saved a lot for me too. The atmosphere couldn't have been nicer, great location, good lighting and ample outdoor seating. However the service was not good I don't think by any standards. First off it took ages, and I mean at least 10 minutes for the first person to come by. Secondly, once we ordered cocktails and waited and waited... now I'm not prudish and I'm good with European service, but when our meals arrived ahead of tableware, and our drinks, I know this is NOT right.

Me not loving cheese too much I think I made the right call for me.Staff was friendly and they even offer tap water and no additional charge.

Le Café,"My friends and I loved Le Cafe! We happened to stumble in during their happy hour and were pleasantly surprised with some special drink choices at fair prices.The cafe itself is very small, narrow and filled with cool items like globes, planes, various travel items. The cafe was quaint but quite popular, packed to the brim with a wait. We had the most handsome older gentleman as our server, very George Clooney-esque. Plus he was incredibly nice, shooting pictures for us from various angles. Honestly, the ambiance was everything you'd want in a Parisian cafe.Happy Hour is from 4-7pm and cocktails during Happy Hour were 6 Euros. I had a Vodka Red Bull, one friend had a mojito and the other had champagne for 8 Euros.I ordered eggs & mayo (oeuf our en coquille) to eat which is apparently a staple on European menus but something you'd never see in the states. I wasn't sure what to expect but it truly was eggs and mayo. Three brown hard boiled eggs came out with a cup of mayo. I wasn't too sure how to eat the dish but peeled the eggs and dipped them a bit in gooey stuff. It became a trip joke how long it took me to peel my eggs to eat them. I ended up with a mess on my plate of yolks which I pretty much skipped and the mayo mixture...but I liked it!Our bill was 47.50 Euros for the egg dish, a curry my friend ordered (13;50 Euros) and 5 drinks. We had a great time and would highly recommend Le Cafe to others looking for a slightly less touristy experience while in Paris.",food pleasant; food pleasant; creme burger; cafe eggs; just got; food time; home wonderful; food pleasant; service wine; food pleasant,5

My tempura was also fried perfectly and I loved the broth of my bf's udon.I was only in Paris for a few days around Christmas time and the restaurant was closed between Christmas Eve and January 3rd or else I would have come here again because it's THAT good.,poached inside; come paris; udon just; come paris; eat soup; food tempura; come days; come paris; udon tempura; come paris,5

A bit of a wait but well worth it!Tired of eating steak frites for the 4th time in a row but not sure what else to try? Look no further! This udon place was so good that my fiance and I came here not once but twice on our week long vacation in Paris. Might be the best udon I've had (granted I've never been to Japan) as it beats out pretty much every place I've had in the US.I ordered the Duck udon both times. The broth was incredibly rich and unique tasting, and the noodle texture was perfect. We came in March around a colder time, and this was the perfect fix on a rainy day. There can be a bit of a line depending on when you go, but its worth the wait!The only downside is that if you are very hungry, it might not be enough to just order one bowl. The duck udon was just a few pieces of protein and noodles, so not too much substance in the bowl, but the taste is on point. It seems like there are other add ons you may want to consider, or plan on hitting a bakery afterwards.The inside is very cramped but its expected for the area.",poached inside; come paris; udon just; come paris; eat soup; food tempura; come days; come paris; udon tempura; come paris,5

I was assured that anything I ordered would be positively delicious and that was indeed the case.In fact, days later I am still thinking about this meal and dreaming up my return visit.What should you order? I can, as my friend assured me, assure you that anything you order will be good.

Sanukiya,"4.5 stars and rounded up! Doing Japanese food proud in Paris! Probably one of the best udon places I've ever eaten at outside of Japan. Came here twice on my recent trip to Paris.Expect a line at each meal, lunch or dinner, since it's a small casual joint that seats about 15 inside at bar areas, and another 10 people in the covered outdoor area. It's a place to loudly slurp down your udon fix while waitstaff greet customers together with ""irasshaimase!"" and bustle about placing and bringing out orders, not a spot to linger for hours with friends--it's also pretty crowded inside--so the queue moves fairly quickly. If you're hungry best bet is still to get there when they open. That being said I must also say the service here was very friendly and polite, they never rushed us even though they do bring you the check once all items have been served--you can take the check to the counter in the back to pay.Trying several items, I must say this spot holds down the fort with traditional staples like iku hoshi udon (beef, poached egg, grated radish), Tempura udon (2 prawn tempura, you can order hibachi tempura udon that comes with vegetable tempura too), and raison udon (mixed seaweed). Each broth is unique and fantastic, I haven't experienced this level of authenticity in flavor since eating in Japan. Their bukkake udon (duck marinated in teriyaki sauce, poached egg) is hands down stellar, that duck is perfectly cooked, tender and savory...I'm drooling right now. Their eggs are poached perfectly. The side order of Gohan, a small bowl of miso pork over rice reminded me of a yummy Japanese breakfast. The udon was probably the one bowl that I might not get again, the yuzu miso broth flavor was ok, but the pork although sliced thinly felt a bit oily.Thanks for two delicious meals!

We were in Paris for a few days as part of a broader France trip, visiting from California, and let dispel any doubts from your thoughts! French cuisine can feel quite heavy with its emphasis on red meat and bread. If you're feeling a change-up, look no further than Sanukiya!We came here for lunch on a Friday in October around 12:30/1pm. The restaurant was already quite full, with a short line outside. We waited about 15 min before being seated, which felt quick. Tables turn over quickly when you're just having udon! They have a small covered outdoor space and the majority of seats are bar-style inside, convenient for seating parties of all different sizes.I ordered a lunch set A, while my partner got just a bowl of udon.

I loved the authenticity of their food and was very impressed with the location and decor.This all being said, I have given them 3 stars, as I believe they took advantage of us as they knew we were tourists. We found unexpected charges on our bill and were pressured into leaving a large tip (our server asked us out loud and recommended a percentage which felt very awkward).I would definitely give it another shot here, as the food was outstanding, but I was a bit turned off by the way that they treated tourists.

Le Bistrot des Vosges,"I went to this bistro on Monday, June 19, for my final night in Paris. I was looking for authentic French cuisine and this was it. They offer both French and English menus but I tried to be more local with my bits and pieces of French but the English menu is much easier for me to read.I had an aperitif consistent of red wine and blackberry liquor which tasted great along with Escargot, which is probably the most recognized French dish outside of the baguette and croissant. It was hard to eat at first until the waiter suggested that I use a napkin rather than the tongs. It tasted great despite the origin of the meat. There was some pause until my lamb chops came which were great and medium as requested. There was some vegetable ratatouille-like side along with a salad. At the end I had Swiss ice cream which was good but not too out of the ordinary.We're in France where the culture is different so I'm not sure if I handled the tipping correctly. I also read that you ask for the bill, they don't bring it to you since that is considered rude as if they were rushing you out. The phrase for the check is ""l'addition s'il vous plaît""All in all France was great aside from the super expensive taxi from the airport when taking the metro would've saved almost 100 euro. Additionally I only stayed for 2 days so there was some troubles at the airport but I'll take that as a lesson learned.

Le Bistrot des Vosges,"Despite me ordering the prime rib cooked medium, it was originally cooked rare. In addition, it was grisly, fatty, tasteless, and difficult to cut with a steak knife. When I pointed out to the waiter that it was undercooked, the kitchen put it back on the grill and cooked it more. It was still grisly, fatty, tasteless, and difficult to cut with a knife afterwards. I ate about four bites and couldn't eat anymore. The manager asked why I didn't eat it but didn't take the dish off our bill when I explained it wasn't palatable. Perhaps this is how Parisians eat their prime rib and I am spoiled by the delicious, tender and perfectly cooked prime rib in the United States, specifically, Texas.In contrast to the steak, I found the chunky French fries delightful.My partner enjoyed his sausage and creamed potatoes with garlic sauce.On a positive note, we were seated immediately on a Wednesday evening with no reservation and the restaurant was aesthetically adorable.I would not eat here again but my partner would.",food tip; soup delicious; eat cooked; french great; food paris; bread cheese; got eat; food good; food paris; food paris,3

Not the case here).For appetizer we shared the beef tatami and it was delicious. For dinner we had the suckling pig dish and the squid ink risotto, both also delicious.

Always a bit scary to go full on with a dish like this, but heck, I'm in Paris and figure this place is hygiene enough to try. I am glad I did. My wife got the octopus as starter and creme fish which she too enjoyed and son got the duck cooked to medium.

He translated the entire menu for us, and even made an ice pack for my Mom who was having a hard time accommodating the July heat. We had a top notch apps which included the mussels, gaspacho, mushrooms with cured ham, and a light and flavorful crab salad. Mains were outstanding...filet mignon with bacon and leeks, kidneys with mashed potato, sweetbreads with chanterelles, and a delightful chicken with Parmesan that my kids devoured. Large portions.

Comme chez Maman,"I'm not sure whose mama cooks like this, but if yours does, I'd like to be invited over for dinner! This was hands down, my favorite dinner during my two weeks in Paris. I will definitely eat here before I return to the States.First, the service was impeccable. As we did not order an entree (normally referred to as an appetizer in English), we were going to have to wait a long while for de boeuf to be cooked. Since they didn't want us to sit there like starved, sad pandas, the waiter came and asked us if we liked mussels.They brought us the sizzling platter of the freshest, most well-seasoned mussels that I have had the fortune of devouring. Next came the de boeuf served with some potatoes. First of all, they advertise it as being for two people. Two ifl players, perhaps, but not two ladies of our stature. I think that it could have easily been for three people. (But, I'm not complaining because I got to enjoy the leftovers as the most highly anticipated lunch of the year!) Finally, we shared a delicious chocolate dessert.If you're ever in the neighborhood, you absolutely have to try this restaurant.

Haven't been to Italy yet and maybe that's the taste, but have had much better. Sauce was tasty, unfortunately, it had too much cheese and the dough was undercooked. morgue sausage looked like Vienna sausages. The pasta bolognese was under seasoned and served with a spaghetti that really didn't stand up to the sauce. Had ice cream after and again, underwhelmed. Didn't have a a homemade or gelato taste or feel.

Gambino,"My lovely bride and I stopped in for an early dinner at bambino on a Tuesday night. We shared the Caesar Salad - it is a generous serving, easily enough for two. The salad is an unusual rendition of a Caesar, but we enjoyed it enough to finish it off. My bride ordered the Penne All'arrabbiata. The pasta is fresh and the red sauce is killer, although not as spicy as she would have liked. She gave it her approval, however, and she is picky about her pasta. The highlight was the Pizza Diavola. Undeniably one of the best pizzas ever. Thin crust, beautiful tomato sauce, mozzarella, and spicy Italian sausage, topped with baby arugula. Absolutely stellar. Service is a little on the brusque side, but prompt and attentive. The baguette was served with an olive oil that was simply perfect - fresh, green and peppery. The ambience is sort of grotto-esque, a very warm atmosphere.

Coretta,"The staff here were extremely kind and it was a nice atmosphere. We ordered I think trout and another type of fish. The vegetables were amazing. But the main appearance; the fish, was so so and also while my husbands fish was 25% uncooked, mine was 50% uncooked. At first I thought it was purposeful for the dish. But my fish was so raw it was like eating rubber and I couldn't pull it off the bone. I think it was a cooking mistake. I should have said something, but again, I assumed and higher end restaurant would not accidentally serve raw fish, and I kept telling myself it was probably cooked that way on purpose but if it was, it was very hard to chew and cut.The bread was dry. The butter flavored with peppercorn was amazing actually. But butter is not automatically served with your bread - I asked for it and it was great.The butter and vegetables were great. My fish was accidentally not cooked and tasted like rubber.For the price, I've had much better food.

It's a bit out of the way if you are staying in a more central location; however, it is well worth a trip to this restaurant.One thing to note is that they do not have menus in English. This was no problem for me; however, I had to verbally translate the menu for my parents.All of the starters are very inventive and the menu changes seasonally. If they have the pork belly, or the beef with bearnaise, these have been my favorite meals. No matter what you order though, you cannot go wrong. Lastly, while not an inexpensive meal, I was shocked by how reasonable the bill was for the caliber service, and quality of the meal.",delicious best; restaurant bit; good ordered; dinner day; fish butter; good impressed; really bit; restaurant bit; restaurant bit; restaurant menu,5

Coretta,"This restaurant is pure perfection.I'm rarely ever in the 17th and never make it a dining destination but this weekend I found myself in this quiet, residential part of the city as part of a wedding anniversary starvation and loretta was our romantic dinner spot.Even though we had been warned that we might be seated at one of the bar stool tables, when we arrived we were given an adorable table alongside the ivy-strewn front window. The seats were comfortable, the place settings modern and original (the utensils have their own smooth wood holders) and the lighting was divine. Really in terms of decorative detail, not a false note anywhere to be found.Then the menu, everything sounded so delicious! I went for the asparagus tempura starter with grilled calamari and a bright green reason and wasabi sauce, which was heavenly and quite generously served. For my main I ordered the poison du jour which was a perfectly prepared filet of lieu noir, super crispy on the skin side and unctuous and soft on the flesh side, served with a bright citrus sauce, stuffed zucchini blossoms and red onions it was seasonal elegant cooking at its best. My husband's doctrine du port which I had a few bites of was the best I've ever had.Though we were quite fill but the time our warm brioche dessert arrived, it was melt in your mouth delicious. Kind of like a cross between a hot cross bun and a cosign amman, buttery, cinnamonny, caramelly, crispy and doughy. Amazing. Go here.

Coretta,"loretta is a stunning gem right by point cabinet and the Martin Luther King Park. Modern and chic, with a Scandinavian feel, plants draping the windows and a humongous lemon on display on the bar.The restaurant has the main floor and an upstairs. I was initially a bit bothered as emailed about making a reservation for a Monday around their opening time-- they replied quickly saying we didn't need one. Ok, cool. WELL. We got there and the only table was flooded by sunlight (downstairs was empty). I secretly wanted to blame them as I had tried to reserve the week prior. PSH. Next time I will be firm with my reservation.Despite the direct sun rays, the food was delicious, and perfect in its presentation. Lunch is cheaper than dinner: 25€ for appetizer/entree of the day or entree/dessert of the day (35€ for the same thing for dinner). So the entree and dessert with a glass of wine comes to under 30€. Not cheap but well worth it in my book. That particular day was a lamb dish that certainly didn't disappoint. The menu had a great variety of dishes- a little something for everyone.Honestly the atmosphere was to die for, even the bread and butter on the side had a little something extra delish. The tables, chairs, everything ...

Le Boui Boui,It was 100 degrees that day in Paris (during that heat wave). So we were thrilled to see some really interesting salads on the menu from which to choose.DH got the Salade Boui-Boui which has duck. I got the salad special which included some cold smoked salmon.

Le Boui Boui,"Cute little restaurant. Had some trouble ordering but eventually got it sorted. The burger was huge and a big hit, and the steak seemed good. I had the beef tartare which was prepared just the way I like it... with just capers and some light seasoning and no saucy mix of something. The alight was ok... really cheesy mashed potatoes and if you don't eat it fast enough it starts to semi-coagulate into a heavy chewy consistency that seems like it would sit in your belly for days. Glad I tried it though, but I thought the roasted potatoes were better.",got boui; good restaurant; bout sausage; place paris; place paris; ordered fiance; potatoes mashed; place paris; place paris; place paris,4
Sacré Frenchy !,"Recommended by Vangie, a co-worker of Aimee's. We came here after a snack earlier of chees, bread and wine so we only had appetizers, but what can I say? The onion soup is the best I have ever had; broth thicker and silky, onions perfectly cooked, just the right amount of sherry, and the gruyere .... We also shared 6 mussels, served in the shell. Out of this world. The phone we had paired perfectly with the meal; dry, red fruits, and as it aerated got even better. If you are in Paris it is well worth the trip.

It a happening place (around 8:30 pm) and fortunately we were able to get an outdoor table. The mood was completed with live entertainment (pianist/singer).We started off with the foi gras and the eggs. Both were really good. We also got some pre dinner cocktails as well. I got the duck breast while my hubby got the slow roasted lamb shank, which came highly recommended by our waiter. The duck was so delicious! All of their meats are from France and responsibly sourced. I got a taste of my hubby's dinner and the lamb shank was also super flavorful.We ended dinner with lemon sorbet and champagne.

It's an informal but intimate environment, with checkered tablecloths and bare stone walls.The food was absolutely fantastic--carpaccio, smoked salmon, onion soup as starters all shone.

Chez Fernand,"What an amazing lunch we had at Chez Fernand!We did not initially have the restaurant on our radar, but my wife found it when browsing dining establishments with tasty-looking Beef Bourguignon - one of many French dishes we hoped to enjoy during our Paris stay.We first ordered a pig trotter dish which was served over green beans. Sure, ""pig trotters"" stand out when I describe that dish, and I am happy to have tried them, but I have never tasted green beans so delicious. Every bit was heavenly.The beef bourguignon was next, and it met our high expectations. The flavors were immense in every bite - a perfect balance of tender beef, golden potatoes, and learned onions. Not a drop of the gravy was left behind!These dishes were perfect for the two of us to share, especially with a couple of craft brews. I cannot recall our waiter's name, but he was from Louisiana and spoke fluent French - kudos to him for the warm and welcoming service. Our delightful experience at Chez fernando will be forever-memorable.",food 10; dishes chez; great best; great best; steak sauce; great best; ordered beef; great best; great best; bone marrow,5
Chez Fernand,I read a fantastic review of this place from one of my favorite chefs in Paris and I had high expectations but I was a bit disappointed. The signature dish is the beef burgundy and it was watery and uneventful. It was just a beef stew for me. I also ordered the baked camembert with honey and that too was..well..I think they forgot the honey. I did have a mouthful.of my husband's ravioli in fois gras sauce. Wow. That was the star of the meal. I wish I ordered it myself. The mini ravioli were stuffed with cope mushrooms and the fois gras creme sauce was outstanding. The wine selection is more than you can imagine.

Chez Fernand,"My wife and I were on the hunt to find some good bone marrow in Paris and stumbled upon Chez fernando while doing our searching. This place looks like it's in a building that's been there for ages with all the wood beams and stone. It's definitely tight and cozy.Instead of ordering an appetizer and main course each we decided to try a few apps and share a main dish and we asked if they could bring it out altogether so we could try everything at once. We ordered the bone marrow, escargot, razor clams, and then the boeuf bourguignon. Every single dish was excellent.The bone marrow was large, well seasoned with salt and came with slices of some rustic bread. It was simple meat butter perfection. The razor clams were beautifully presented in a sort of tower, cooked to perfection and topped with tomatoes, onions and an herb infused oil. The escargot was exactly how good escargot should be prepared with lots of herbs and butter. Lastly the boeuf bourguignon was so tender, rich and flavorful. It's the kind of stew where you need a nap afterwards. I definitely recommend sharing it because it is a lot of richness and flavor for one person.The service here was also very good. Everyone was very polite and helpful. They even helped us put our jackets on before we left.If you want some traditional French food done exquisitely well, I think you need to check this place out.",food 10; dishes chez; great best; great best; steak sauce; great best; ordered beef; great best; great best; bone marrow,5

Chez Fernand,"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever dined at. The food was AMAZING. I've been thinking about it since I returned from Paris a month ago. You have to come here at least once.Onion soup: Show-stopping. She is the main character. Absolutely amazing and I loved how much cheese they loaded on top. It was seriously so good that I dream about her.Bone Marrow: Was honestly not that amazing. I wished it was more salted or had some kind of sauce. It was basically just straight bone marrow paired with bread, and it wasn't seasoned enough to my liking.Beef Bourguignon: GET THIS. My god. Chez fernando is known for this dish for a reason, and it was absolutely divine. The beef was so tender, and the sauce was so rich and flavorful. So many layers of flavors. I'm salivating as I think about it.Dessert: Chocolate lava cake (I forgot what it was called on the menu) was pretty good. It wasn't anything incredibly amazing but definitely a nice way to end dinner.Service: Honestly, pretty meh. They didn't bring another bottle of water when we ran out (Not sure if we were limited to one bottle) and they didn't check on us during dinner.

What a super cute place this was and it ended up being one of my favorites during our week+ visit. From the time we arrived to when we bade them farewell, we had the most welcoming dining experience one could hope for. I want to say our server was also the owner of this little hidden gem and he was darling.For all of us non-French speakers, they conveniently have a chalkboard with their menu drawn out for us (see pic). For starters, we tried their creamed spinach soup with a soft boiled egg and OMG, it was mike drop amazing! For reference, it's listed as the boeuf coyote an et creme de muscade. We also shared the crab cannelloni. Fresh and delicate but it didn't hold a candle next to the soup.For entrees, we went with the duck and the scallops. The duck was cooked a perfect medium rare and the scallops were oh-so-flavorful served in a light vanilla cream sauce with a nice veggie succotash. Both dishes had just enough sauce left over to dip your baguette into it sinfully.Overall, a super memorable experience.

Think caprese salad but with more tomato and less mozzarella which was great after eating so much rich food all day. For my entree I had the king shrimp with asparagus that was topped with a tomato sauce that was excellent. The shrimp and asparagus were perfectly cooked and the sauce was so flavorful and great for mopping up the bread they provide. My husband had the pork rib (pork chop) with a mustard sauce and what looked like mashed potatoes but may have been a different vegetable but regardless was excellent.

For the main courses we enjoyed the veal and steak. The steak was peppery and delicious, prepared in the proper French way. The veal was tender with a crispy breading. The steak was served with a generous portion of heaping hot fries. The veal served with a refreshing arugula salad topped with fresh tomatoes and Parmesan. Cannot complain!

We also had the shrimp roll, a delectable sea bass ceviche, a bowl of tiny mussels in curry broth that was just SO delicious and a whole pan fried sea bream atop a thin cushion of pea pure and topped with red cabbage & carrot. Everything was superb and our server was swift and smiling throughout the evening.The restaurant itself is small & charming with a simple rustic feel.

I stumbled upon it when I was searching for 'best beef bourguignon in Paris' and this was one of the places that popped up. Though I've had limited experience in eating this dish, I can still say it is an incredibly indulgent, flavorful dish that should be eaten while in France. The foie gras with warm toasted bread was rich and creamy. I left the restaurant and was consequently struck with severe food coma while I was in Versailles.

Joséphine chez Dumonet,"I was feeling nostalgic and wanted a classic French meal. I choose Chez Dumonet. The inside decor indicates that this place has seen some shit. A bit a history and a bit of wear and tear.They sat me and my partner in the front part of the restaurant and proceeded to ask the next 4 reservations if they wanted the front or the back. Odd they didn't ask us, but upon seeing Yelp reviews, we see that being sat in the back had a bit of a negative stigma, so maybe they were trying not to sit us next to the stinky we in the back or the hot kitchen.I order the seared foie gras for a starter and the classic cassoulet with pork, duck leg, and lamb sausage as my main. My partner in crime orders the artichoke starter and the duck confit for their main. For dessert we order their famous Grand mariner soufflé.The service: frenetic. The servers are running around like a poulet with its head cut off. There is clearly a backstory happening during this dinner service that we are not fully aware of. I see them cut up a chateaubriand for another table that is still absolutely raw. The two main servers are arguing about it in French and the consensus is serve it and see if the customers complain.Now, how was my food? Quite good. The foie was just as you want it: hot and supple. The cassoulet: prepped days in advanced and hiding a giant sausage underneath its exterior. The artichokes? A bit lacking in seasoning. The duck? Not quite crispy enough and the accompanying potatoes were bland. The soufflé? A bit disappointing as the alcohol had not fully been cooked out and it was on the runner side.Some hits. Some misses. A good experience but likely not repeated.",amazing delicious; bit duck; paris amazing; owner night; got want; french experience; restaurant bread; paris dish; paris amazing; paris amazing,3
Joséphine chez Dumonet,"We arrived for our reservation to a nearly empty restaurant, and were promptly ushered to a partly walled-off seating area in the back, adjoining an odorous restroom and open kitchen door. To our surprise, the back was filled with Asian patrons, while the front had been sparsely seated with a few Caucasian clientele. It's not hard to understand what was happening--the ""less desirable"" patrons (in our case, Asian) were being seated out of view. As a side note, there were some (white) English speakers seated up front, and we did our best to communicate in our limited French, so while certainly contributory, I don't think the language barrier was the preeminent factor.I should have gotten up and left the moment I realized what was happening. Fool that I was, we stayed and had the most overpriced and mediocre French food I have ever endured. (Beef bourguignon doesn't quite taste the same when it arrives with a side of degradation, I suppose.)Reviews from previous diners attest to my experience as a long-standing pattern of subpar service and second-class treatment by Chez Dumont. I'm so angry that I paid for such a humiliating experience.",amazing delicious; bit duck; paris amazing; owner night; got want; french experience; restaurant bread; paris dish; paris amazing; paris amazing,1

Joséphine chez Dumonet,"I've read about their segregation practices and I was sad to see for myself it's still a current practice. Is it because they have only a few dedicated English speaking servers? Do they want us to see the chef at work in the kitchen? Or they want to close the door and keep us isolated? Who knows what they are thinking but they should get rid of the dividing door if they want people to feel welcome.To the restaurant: TEAR DOWN THE DIVIDING WALL. It's like the Berlin wall in here.The servers are nice enough so the criticism isn't for them but for the layout of the room. It's very isolating for someone wanting to not feel so alone.For everyone else: THIS PLACE IS FAR FROM ROMANTIC SO BOOK ELSEWHERE FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS if u are not French.I really really really wanted to disprove all those reviews but alas, it's all true. But on to the food...We got an amuse buthe that was tasty. Then came sourdough bread with butter... I read that bread with butter is an American practice, not practiced by the French so thus the ""American section"" theory.The menu: all in french, so DO YOUR RESEARCH AHEAD OF TIME.Timing: we got to the restaurant 20 minutes before they opened at 1230, we got our amuse buthe and bread with butter within minutes and they took our order at 1250. We literally took until they closed at 1425 to finish our meal.Drinks: there is no drinks menu... Just a wine menu. We asked for coca cola and a coffee with cream.The food:CONFIT DE CANARD DE Maison (€29) - the house duck confit. The fries were OK and the duck was tasty. The skin was a little crispy.TARTARE (FILET DE boeuf ) (€39) - made table side, this was a fun demonstration. I'm not a big tartare fan but this was palatable even for me.BEOUF bourguignon AUX tagliatelle (€30) or €20 if u want half order... Of course we got the full order and couldn't finish it because I ended up not liking the sauce very much. The noodle and the super tender meat was great but the sauce was too much for me.For dessert, we got their AU GRAND mariner serve avec son petit verre (€18). The light at the end of the tunnel, this was the highlight of this experience. I'd come back just for this. You get a small glass of grand mariner but we dont really drink so we ate it by itself with a drop of the liqueur here and there. I think they have some at the bottom already so the bottom was too strong for us and we ended up not eating it.Would I come back? Maybe for the souffle but otherwise probably not until they tear down that wall",amazing delicious; bit duck; paris amazing; owner night; got want; french experience; restaurant bread; paris dish; paris amazing; paris amazing,3
Joséphine chez Dumonet,"Make a reservation for this restaurant, learn some basic French and take your Google translate app, you won't regret it!I had seen this restaurant pop up in many restaurant reviews and decided to try it on my recent trip to Paris.WOW! I cannot get over how absolutely delicious everything was!!The restaurant is extremely small and EXTREMELY busy! The wait staff is buzzing about from table to table bringing everything piping hot from the kitchen. They have a strong rhythm here. They come take your order, bring your drinks, bring you bread and butter, then your appetizer, then main course then dessert. Any attempt to ask for anything extra in between disrupts the flow for everyone. We had to ask multiple times for more water and bread before one waiter caught my eye on his way back to the kitchen and he did a quick u-turn and grabbed me a bottle of water and dropped it off quickly before he disappeared back to the kitchen.There is a sense of grandeur in how they serve your meals. We watched them prepare the beef Tartare table side for a group of 6 people. The waiter had a whole tray of condiments and dropped them in from above and whisked everything together and individually plated the meal for everyone. It was dinner AND A show!Appetizers first:Prosciutto and Melon as well as the green salad.Everything was so fresh and light, they also brought us fresh bread and butter.Main Course :Boef Bourguignon and the is de Veau with Pommes de terre amazing! The sauce of the Bourguignon was the best I've ever had. Usually restaurants leave these with a heavy taste of wine which I don't like, but they must cook this for hours! The gravy is so flavorful and the meat literally falls apart. I will say that I feel they give you too little pasta but, if you can catch one of the busy waiters, just ask for more bread so that you can soak up the beautiful leftover sauce.The veal was so tender and juicy, the chips were an excellent texture compliment.The souffle was out of this world, lightly sweet and like having a piece of cloud melt in your mouth. The shot of Grand mariner they serve with it is VERY strong. If you're not a fan of heavy alcohol flavors, add the shot to your souffle with a light hand, LOL!I can't wait to come back to Paris so I can eat here again! The prices are above average but worth every penny.EDIT SIDE NOTE:I read other reviews about the staff being rude or discriminatory, and I think that is laughable. My family sat towards the front of the restaurant, we are Mexican American, our French is terrible, but we made the effort and the staff did their best to try and communicate in what little English they spoke. I say the rule of thumb for any traveler is to make the effort to speak the language of whatever country you are in. It goes a long way just saying ""I'm sorry I don't speak French."" ( Désolé, je no comprends français. Google translate was my best friend!!)

I put it on the bread as well, and it was a perfect combo.Third course: Veal. The only reason I'm rating this restaurant as 4 instead of 5 is because I wish I had went with the crispy duck over the veal.

The prices were high compared to the quality and the wines were just ok, and WAY over priced. It was kind of a disappointment.

Ordered the avocado toast to start which was very pretty but extremely bland, needed some more salt and acid in my opinion. For our meals we had the fried chicken sandwich and the steak. Sandwich was great although we got the bottom of the barrel in terms of fries with it. The steak was a very rough cut, extremely fatty and chewy, I personally dont enjoy steak like that and a lot of it was inedible because it was majority fat. The potatoes au gratin on the side though we're impeccably delicious. I don't think I would return personally because overall the meal was quite underwhelming, but service was good and the restaurant is nice and in a good area so maybe if you ordered better (chicken sandwich and swap in potatoes au gratin?) you would enjoy more.",eiffel tower; kids food; really paris; sandwich steak; eiffel tower; fine excellent; eiffel tower; friendly really; eiffel tower; good tower,3

I think it's important to note that 3 stars is still good (""A-OK""), and bistro was good. It probably could have been better if I ordered something else, but you have to review based on what you got, and this entree was just good. Nothing special.When you don't really know a language, menus can sound so interesting. This one had either an english menu or english translation on the menu, so I knew what I ordered, but it sounded more interesting than it was. Essentially, I got ham macaroni and cheese. It was a small pot filled with macaroni pasta, ham, very finely chopped mushrooms, and Parmesan cheese. Nothing wrong with it. This was a good dish, but that's it. It was just good. Shame, too, because this menu looks awesome. I don't know why I went with this dish, but I guess it called to me, and as usual, the voices in my head were wrong. I should stop listening to them. Doing what the voices tell you to do is a sure sign you've lost your mind. Having voices is fine, as long as you ignore them and don't tell anyone you hear them.On the positive side, my first glass of wine - a Bordeaux - was superb. My second glass was still good but not as good as the first.Service was again, great. Welcoming of us who only have a very limited and basic knowledge of the language (like, 300 words or less basic) and otherwise rely on google translate. Standard Parisian service in that it is slow, but that's just France. Meals are slow - you're supposed to enjoy the experience - not just rush in and out.I also didn't love where we were sat - in the back of the restaurant in a small room or alcove. It was very hot back there - lie the room absorbed the heat and didn't let it escape - and a bit cramped. There was no need to sit us back there either as we had a reservation and the restaurant was half empty.Here's the thing though - I would come back. The menu had a number of very interesting items that sounded fantastic and look great in the yelp and photos. Willing to assume I ordered wrong and should have gotten something else - maybe something that doesn't belong on the kids menu.Oh well.

Bistrot Vivienne,"My family was so jet lagged, we slept for 12 hours and woke up in time to search for dinner. Many places were closed or closing. bistro was one of the few still open on New Year Day. We were seated immediately outside with a perfect view for people watching. There was a light drizzle of rain, the street was quiet, couples walked by hand in hand. It was an enchanting evening.The servers were attentive without being intrusive. The food was divine! I had the scallop carpaccio starter that was light, refreshing, with a touch of umami. For our main, we had a perfect steak with foi gras. It came with green beans that I swear I would return to Paris for. Just the green beans.For American visitors, I recommend you sit back and enjoy socializing with your friends and family. Meal time is a lingering affair in Paris, I've been told. It took me a couple of dinners to get used to the pace, but I love it now. bistro Vivienne, pour me a glass of port and bring me dessert whenever you get around to it.

Le Vaudésir,"This place is incredible and a must visit to try a truly traditional Parisian cafe.I met the owner, Pierre Cristophe, by chance while eating at another restaurant in the city, and he invited me to come try his wife's home-cooked faire at his cafe. I took him up on the offer and was wowed. The food is beautifully prepared with fresh and simple ingredients. It tastes much healthier than French foods I have tried at other restaurants, which I think go a little overboard on the butter and cream. M. christophe makes a delicious espresso to complement the faire. Everything is ridiculously cheap compared to other restaurants, only bring your Euros because they proudly do not accept credit cards, in keeping with the Cafe's 100+ year tradition of serving things the classic way. The cafe serves traditional plates that very each day, with entrees, principle plates (including a plat du jour), cheeses, deserts, wine, and freshly baked bread.What's most lovely, on top of the great food and drinks, is how kind and welcoming the staff and guests are. Locals come every day to meet and converse with each other, and they will be most excited to see a new visitor. Despite my very poor French, many guests and staff came over to chat with me in frenglish, and everyone wanted to give me advice about what to see and do in Paris. Their advice was on point!

Pain Vin Fromages,You have to order the fondue and roulette per person here so we ordered a 2 person roulette and 2 person fondue and it was more than enough!

I got here early and waited for half an hour only to realize that the inside of the restaurant was suspiciously dark and all the tables and chairs were still up. Finally ended up finding a note in French on the door that the restaurant was closed. I was shocked and deeply disappointed that they hadn't even bothered to notify me.

The cheese for the roulette lacked the burnt texture and would harden back quickly, most likely because the cheese served was a soft cheese not a hard cheese. The fondue cheese and wine didn't mix nor complement each other. The meat was okay.

Be ready to be cozy with others as the tables are close by.They have cheese boards with various types from across the country, pretty good size cheese wedges too! And of course the fondue! Many different types to choose from, they come with bread slices. Also ordered meat in the side, chose mixed meat which gave 4 different types of meat to go along with your cheese.

Pain Vin Fromages,"I highly recommend making a reservation online - it is quick, easy, and helps you avoid a long wait!My party of four and I ordered a classic cheese fondue, a raclette, and a salad (have to balance out the heavy meal somehow, right?) The menu is rather limited with heavy emphasis on cheese. I wanted to try meat and oil fondue but unfortunately each fondue order is made for two persons to share. Between the roulette and fondue, it would have been too much food for us.I was not disappointed, the cheese fondue is delicious. I loved the white wine flavor in it and the servers gave us plenty of bread to dip. Alongside the bread we also had an assortment of deli meats and small pickles. The roulette is ""do it yourself"" as well. My table was given a mini roulette broiler and we could fill up the small pans and scrape the cheese onto our potatoes. I thought the fondue was better tasting than the raclette.As far as fondue goes, Pain vin fromage is one of the best. They use high quality cheeses and the servers are so accommodating to English speakers. Like many French restaurants, I found the interior to be quite cramped and the tables very small. It was interesting trying to maneuver around the hot objects at our table and the large plates of food. The fondue pots have their own flame but the roulette makers are haphazardly plugged into one of the many power strips in the wall.The nature of the food is very heavy - cheese, bread, cheese, potatoes, more cheese.

It makes for a more intimate romantic and interesting environment.We ordered The salad with goat cheese and cucumbers, which was delicious. The goat cheese medallions were essentially half inch discs. For the fondue we ordered the savored which was delicious. The service was quick, very friendly, and the fondue was beyond expectations. We wanted to try the cheeseboard, but decided discretion was the better part of valor.

They have English menus available if needed. I ordered the karate ramen which was brought out in about 15 minutes or so! It had a nice, spicy broth! It was very creamy and flavorful, the noodles and meat both tender. I opted to add an egg with mine and the inside was perfectly custardy. This was some of the best ramen i've had!It was the perfect cure for a cold, rainy day!",ve good; ve good; ve good; broth ramen; ve good; ramen really; ramen ve; ve good; ramen pork; good came,5

This is the first time I had to wait in a reasonably sized line for it but as always, it was worth the wait.This is ""near the Louvre"" but it's really not. It's quite a walk from there.It was (of course) cold & chilly so ramen was the perfect meal to help me power through my shopping excursion afterwards.Both bao buns were good but I think I actually liked the chicken better than the pork this time.I forgot which ramen I ordered but you can't go wrong.

Ippudo Louvre,"Spotted this Japanese gem when eating at an amazing French restaurant nearby the night before. As soon as we started walking up we saw a woman outside slurping her noodles with her chopsticks and we said yes! We're here! We got seated right away and we're offered the English menus. Very comforting interior, warm and cozy feeling on a cold night like tonight.We started with the croquettes were absolutely satisfying, very crispy on the outside and soft potato filling on the inside glazed with their signature sauce. Next came the pork belly hinata bun! Loved and appreciated how the pork belly was cooked. We've had buns elsewhere, and if the pork is over cooked it will ruin the entire bun. This was not the case here. I ordered the kawaru damage ramen with jutsu noodles. The flavor was deliciously and more importantly, the egg was not over cooked at all. Perfection! My girlfriend ordered the karate damage ramen with jutsu noodles and she enjoyed hers as well, except she did wish it was more on the spicier side.Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience at ippo and appreciated the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff.

I went to this location for the first time last week, and I was surprised at how large the space was-I've been to several other both in ny and Paris, and this was probably the biggest ippo I've been to. I also noticed the decor wasn't really in line with their brand, which leads me to believe they probably didn't change out the furniture from the previous restaurant here, no big deal-just an observation.I was very hungry, and arrived shortly before they opened. I was one of the first patrons for the dinner service. The pork belly bun was delicious packed with pork and full of flavor. I ordered a yuzu bomb, so refreshing-I want to mix this drink at home. The ramen was incredible, everything about it was perfect-the perfectly cooked egg and noodles, the tasty broth and pork.

The broth is thinner but definitely has all that porky goodness, and I'm a sucker for black garlic oil.They also have Tokyo Tsukemen, available only in limited quantities. I love tsukemen, but it's not for everyone. The broth is fifty-fifty and fishy, and the dipping adds an extra step if you're really hungry.If you've never had ramen, ippo is a great place to start.

20 Eiffel,"Europe 2023 - my birthday dinner and our first day I Paris we visited the Eiffel Tower and had dinner at 20 Eiffel. They don't open until 7PM and you should get a reservation, but we luckily were able to get a seat out on the street with a great view of the Eiffel Tower just as sunset was happening and the lights were turned on on the tower.FASTFood: very good. We chose their dinner special, appetizer, entree and desert, which has some limited choices but all were good. I had the cold mashed peas with smoked salmon and this was really good, the salmon adds a great flavor, and soaked up the remainder with some of the bread. My wife had the mushroom with egg, and she didn't let me have a bite but said it was good. We both had the beef dish, which came with a nice sauce and potatoes. We topped this off with the Grand mariner & Pina Colada souffles & a bottle of wine.Atmosphere: it's as you would expect, sitting on the street with traffic and arms length away passing you by. Several other groups sitting close to us all enjoying the view. Actually pretty spectacular.Service: exceptional! We don't speak any French and everyone was very helpful.Tips: make a reservation and see if you can turn your table so that both you and your significant other can glance at the Eiffel Tower while enjoying a great meal.",restaurant views; eiffel chocolate; food restaurant; restaurant tower; great reasonable; restaurant views; entree restaurant; decor wine; eiffel tower; food come,5

Serving size is almost large. The duck salad had loads of duck meat which overpowered the green. It was also very oily, I did not even put the dressing, which was in a single serve packet, the size of creamer cups in the US, which I reckon wouldn't cut the fatty oils. If I was home I would've added more greens and more acidic dressing. I couldn't enjoy it much.

The entire place appeared spotless clean. Staff was attentive and cheerful.Proper tableware is used. The plate used to serve fries was a ceramic-coated steel plate that easily could have come from a country home in Provence ( including the requisite, small ""chip""). The metal tray holding it all was industrial-grade and could have easily been at home in a military canteen. The presentation was quite charming.I ordered one Burger Aubergine combo w/ fries & drink. The bun was nice & soft but not over volumnious. The meat was pressed to some degree like a patty, but still had the natural meat consistency of pulled duck meat. So, it had the texture of real meat not some hyper-processed ""pink slime."" There were real veggies, arugula, butter lettuce, onions , fig paste, and a semi-soft cheese.It was immaculately executed: flavor, texture, smell, appearance...it was delicious and perfect. On the other hand, the fries were ok, passable. They were served hot, a bit limp & not firm nor crispy. They were ok in taste, perfect amount of salt...but don't go there for the fries. Go there for the Meat...the Duck Burger.Hints:(1) I was there at noon, and they had no change for a 20 euro note, so I paid with a CC(2) I ordered in French, but the two young gals manning the counter had trouble placing the order for some on the non-French speakers who showed up. Though, there are menus with English descriptions.(3) They will stingily, only provide One packet of ketchup. It took politely asking twice, saying ""Please"" (in English) with a super- wide smile, even though I had initially placed the order in French, to get the second packet.(4) Around the area, there are quite a few Japanese and Asian restaurants that are so popular the lines are about half a city block long!!! ...might be worth exploring if you have the time.",confit great; duck good; confit great; confit great; street canard; confit great; confit great; duck excellent; place meat; confit great,5

La Poule au Pot,"My partner and I arrived at pole au Pot no more than a minute or two late for a 9:00 p.m. reservation that had been made through the restaurant's online reservation system almost a month in advance. Upon arriving and greeting the host and mentioning our reservation in French, ""Thomas"", responded to us in English that he did not have a reservation for us. When I showed him the confirmation email, he pointed at the date on the email that notes when the reservation was made and insisted that was the date of our reservation and that we had made a mistake. While my French is bad, it isn't that bad, and I pointed to the proper date for our reservation noted on the email. Once I did that, he insisted that I had not clicked the ""Confirmer Ma Reservation"" link in the email and that our reservation had been canceled. He tried to prove the point by having me click on the link while in the restaurant. When I did so, the reservation website brought up an ""Authorisation refusee"" message that the host used as justification for saying that we didn't have a reservation. The problem? Since it was now a few minutes (no more than five) after our reservation time, this is the message that the website displays whether or not a reservation has been confirmed. I know that I had confirmed the reservation promptly a few days earlier, but since the reservation system doesn't generate confirmation emails, there was no way of proving it.When I asked if we could be accommodated anyway, noting a few empty tables in the restaurant, we were told that they were booked for the night. I then asked if it would be possible to make a reservation in the next few days. ""Thomas"" was completely unhelpful, refusing to look up availability and only gave us the restaurant's card and told us that they might have availability ""tomorrow or Monday"" and to call and ask for him. We then left annoyed by the situation but me mostly mad at myself that I had somehow made a mistake in booking and confirming the reservation.About 15 minutes later we arrived back at our hotel room, at which point the anger at myself shifted to the restaurant and the host, ""Thomas"". In looking online to see if another reservation was available during the remainder of our stay in Paris, I discovered that there was a 9:30 p.m. reservation available that evening, so the host's insistence that the restaurant was booked for the night was a lie. Furthermore, I discovered that the restaurant is closed on Sundays and Mondays - the two days that the host told us that the restaurant may have availability.Since the two of us arrived on time for the reservation, were dressed in a manner and style similar to the other diners, greeted the host in French, and were polite during the entire interaction, it is difficult to come to the conclusion that we were turned away and treated as we were for any other reason than we were a gay couple. I would recommend that any get person who wishes to dine at this restaurant to do so only with the expectation of the possibility of being refused service, and a backup reservation at another establishment in place.",au food; good soup; magnificent best; fantastic good; magnificent best; magnificent best; reservation restaurant; sauce delicious; magnificent best; french great,1

La Poule au Pot,"La pole au Pot made our last night in Paris really something special. Sitting in the center of Paris since 1945 in a quiet neighborhood made up of small Cafes and Bars, it gave us a great feeling when we walked in. A beautiful dining room, white table clothes and sparkling wine and water glasses, I knew right off my Yelp Collection list, someone hit this on the nose for a great recommendation. After I took a glance at the menu and HUGE French Wine collection, I knew it for sure.It gave us superb French menu choices all in French with a friendly and funny server that fooled us into the fact he did not speak English, but he actually did and was able to give us great recommendations from start to finish. He had a great sense of humor and spotted us as Americans, which I am sure he was used to. Therefore when he started to laugh as he rattled off ""the Filet"" ""Frog Legs"", etc, he knew he was playing with us in a good way. Pretty funny and not typical of what some people think of the French attitude towards visitors who do not speak French. In fact so many places were great to us and tried to communicate in some form of English.My wife and I both love the Escargot in Paris and we also checked to make sure they served it here. In fact after we got into the whole menu with our server, we knew this may become a feast. We did not care, it was our last night. The Escargot was served with a small bowl of the soft part of the inside of the baked rolls, just for dipping. This was besides the basket of rolls we always get.So, after opening up a great bottle of Bordeaux from the medic region of France, we of course ordered the Escargot. Twelve large ones in a nice garlic butter with a pesto I have to believe. Delicious. We also tried the Frog Leg Appetizer, not much meat on Frog Legs, but certainly succulent off the bones. A true delicacy and whatever seasonings they cooked these with in light sauce I'd wish there was more meat on the bone. The salad my wife ordered was huge and we split that as well.We had to order our entree's with the appetizers to give the kitchen time to prepare, but in no way were we rushed in to eating the main courses.Such a relaxing time and very timely service.My wife ordered the Filet Mignon, which came in a brown sauce that the server spooned over the meat. This Filet had the tenderness and more flavor than most Filet I ordered the Sweet Bread, which is a meat delicacy, in this case beef. Never had it before, but this was the most tender and flavorful meat I've ever had cooked in a restaurant.Halfway through our meal, our server came over with a pile of French Fries, White Rice and Mashed Potatoes. Not expected, but French Fries and especially mashed potatoes are very popular side dishes. Tried them both and one spoonful of the rice. Perfection, especially those fries.It all sounds like a whole lot of food, and it was, but we sat for a good 2 hours over that bottle of wine and loved this just for the atmosphere itself. Never felt overwhelmed or ""stuffed"". Just lay low on the carb side dishes.Whoever recommended this to me, please come forward so I can thank you. This is a Paris traditional experience and they must be doing it right for locals as well as tourists from all over the globe since 1945.",au food; good soup; magnificent best; fantastic good; magnificent best; magnificent best; reservation restaurant; sauce delicious; magnificent best; french great,5

La Réserve de Quasimodo,"Probably my favourite restaurant during my week in Paris. It's a small place near Notre Dame owned by a husband and wife. One of them came over to us to explain their menu and the different options we could get. I decided on the cod in creamy sorrel sauce and my girlfriend got the smoked salmon and spinach pie. Both were great, but the best part of the meal was the bread pudding with wine jam that we ordered for dessert. The wife told us that the recipe for the jam was made in-house by the chef who experimented with a few herbs and spices that she at first found doubtful, but very quickly fell in love with (as did we). I'd definitely recommend it.What makes this experience five-star worthy though was the atmosphere. Everyone was so friendly and talkative that I could relax and unwind from a pretty exhausting day. At the other Parisian restaurants we visited, the customers kept to themselves, without much interaction with the staff. Here, I was talking to the tables beside me, and it was actually another couple that suggested we get the bread pudding.Thoroughly enjoyed and wish I could go back.P.S. The wife speaks fluent French (obvously), English, Spanish (wow), and some Chinese (standing ovation right here)",place food; near definitely; great place; morning pretty; great wife; wine orange; great place; great staff; great place; great place,5
La Réserve de Quasimodo,My favorite place in Paris.

Le Relais de l’Entrecôte,"I read a ton of reviews so I knew what to expect. Long waits even right before closing. We waited about an hour and a half, and it was raining. I actually thought that there would be a shorter wait because of the weather.The restaurant is quite big, but the tables are all close together. So there's a ton of seating inside and outside. You go and they ask you how you want your steak cook. The portions that they give I think or a good size, a ton of delicious french fries perfectly cooked crispy. The steak itself was decent, the sauce on top is what makes it so good! And then you use your fries to eat all the sauce on the plate. We ordered the eclairs with chocolate for dessert and this was my favorite! Service is pretty good, towards the end of the night they started cleaning up, so I think they were not as focused on helping the tables.I would come back, if I could somehow get in there without waiting more than 30 minutes.",line time; sauce salad; sauce salad; sauce good; sauce salad; steak line; fries steak; line seconds; wait place; sauce salad,4

The sauce looked better than it was. It was very oily and heavy with very little flavor. I was expecting more flavor for sure.

Le Relais de l’Entrecôte,Just another one of those over-rated tourist places!! And over-priced too!! Someone said how they loved the fact that they give you seconds. Well I would sure hope so since the first serving of the steak and fried are about the size of a kids meal!!!! The steak is definitely pretty good. It's probably a NY steak. But it's not worth a 1-2 hour wait in line!!! We found a little place just down the street that has a much better steak and fries!!! And it's for about the same price too and it was a ribeye!!Definitely save yourself the time and money if there's a long line.,line time; sauce salad; sauce salad; sauce good; sauce salad; steak line; fries steak; line seconds; wait place; sauce salad,3
Le Relais de l’Entrecôte,"Yes, just OK. Once again we were lulled into the tourist trap. We have now been lulled four or five times!!! The first time we tried to go the line was around the corner prior to the place opening. We were about 200 back. They opened and the first wave got in. I left my partner in line and went to count how many were left...only about 120. I sent a text and said ""we are out of here"". On our last in Paris we decided to attempt a second time. This time it was about 1:30PM and the line only had about 20 people when we got there. Still had about a 20 minute wait.We ordered. Not a choice as we knew. So we got the with a greenish sauce and fries. The was cooked perfectly but that is about all that was perfect about it. It was so tough. The sauce, that I remember being the best part of the meal was a bit off tasting. Wish I could pin point the taste. It was not very good. The fries were the best part of the meal.The place was packed, bumper to bumper. The ladies that work there looks absolutely exhausted. And they work so very hard. Service was very attentive.The cost was $27.50 and it was all one can eat. One should go at least once. And sad part is we will probably go back.

Le Relais de l’Entrecôte,"Bread, salad, steak, pomme frites. What more can you ask for? Everything tasted amazing. To start off, the salad was really really good. I probably could have just eaten that. I asked for the steak to be medium and it came out perfectly. Loved the sauce. The fries were super crispy and delicious. After you finish your first serving you can top off on both steak and fries again. But, it is a lot of fries. No complaints, everything was delicious.",line time; sauce salad; sauce salad; sauce good; sauce salad; steak line; fries steak; line seconds; wait place; sauce salad,4
Le Relais de l’Entrecôte,"My lunch was short and sweet. I arrived at the restaurant exactly at 11:30 and there were already 6 people in line waiting for the doors to open at noon. When that time came, the line was extensively longer - the indoor seating was packed within minutes. There was still outdoor seating available.The waitstaff was lovely. It seemed every 5 minutes they had to tell a group of diners that there's a line outside and they never got annoyed or rude with anyone. They were also very attentive and you can't get that kind of service most places.I gave the restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought the food was a little above average. It wasn't anything I would brag about, but it was a decent meal and I enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of salad so I only ate it until the steak and frites came, but I liked the touch of walnuts. I liked the steak sauce especially with the fries, but neither was absolutely amazing on its own. The steak itself wasn't cooked to the right temperature for me, but that may be because the US and France have different standards (obviously). Nevertheless, the meat was tender, easy to cut, and went down well. I just wish it had more seasoning. This was the first time I tried profiteroles. I thought there would be more to them, but I wasn't disappointed. You can't lose with the combination of chocolate, almonds, vanilla ice cream, and puff pastries.It's always a somewhat difficult adjustment to evaluate your expectations when it comes to the quality of food when traveling to different countries. Because I'm so used to over-seasoned/salted American food, I think my unhealthy preferences took away from the food at this restaurant. It's a good restaurant that is always packed. It's definitely worth trying (and ignoring my bias) if you have the craving for steak.",line time; sauce salad; sauce salad; sauce good; sauce salad; steak line; fries steak; line seconds; wait place; sauce salad,4
Le Relais de l’Entrecôte,This place is often raved about on social media so we decided to give it a try.We headed over about 30 mins before they opened for dinner and we were probably like the 15th in line and as time passed the line was down the next block.We were seated shortly after they started letting people in. The meal is preset with bread and a salad with mustard dressing first. The mustard was a little too strong for my liking. Next is the main course of their famous and only dish - steak and frites which is smothered in their secret sauce. You will of course be given a choice of how you want your steak cooked. Food was just so so for me. Not bad but definitely not what I was expecting with all the hype and the line. Still a good place to go if your hungry as they will offer generous seconds!Staff is very kind and attentive.Dessert is not included in the meal but they have lot to choose from in case you want to add on.

Seating is super packed and tight but they have a system. Our waiter was amazing, so friendly and gave recommendations when needed.Now on to the most important part, the food! The salad & bread weren't bad but nothing to rave about. The steak & fries were good - have I had better absolutely but the sauce is what makes it different. We got profiteroles chocolat for dessert and loved it!I'd say if you're in the area, give this place a try but time it so your wait isn't over an hour.

We looked up burger spot's close by and mind you we already had several good burgers in France by this point in our trip. the service was extremely slow and the waiters were kind of rude. First I ordered a beer and they gave me the wrong one. The I ordered escargot and burger both were alright. My wife had onion soup which had no taste as her app, then ordered the Croque Madame she did not like it. My kids both had burgers and they did not like them. Understand that they use a cheese sauce not pieces of cheese. The burgers were almost raw when the kids got them. Had to send both back to get cooked longer and even when they got them again, they were still very under. The service was definitely lack luster. This was one of two places that while we were in Paris. The bathroom downstairs was disgusting as well. I would stay away and search elsewhere.

It also helps that the waiters speak food English being that I'm not from France.However, while the food is delicious, the food takes awhile to come out when they're really busy. We had to wait for around 40 mins for our appetizers to come out but in the end it was worth it since it tasted so good.Overall it's an excellent dining experience and a good Asian fix if you ever need one in France.",got good; restaurant friendly; good got; good got; vietnamese good; good got; beef hot; good got; come wasn; vietnamese dong,4

Dong Phat,"Was really craving bun and this was the closest Viet restaurant with good reviews. It was more mixed dishes, I think. We got the vermicelli and map tofu.The place itself wasn't too busy so was surprised that the food took awhile to come.The bun flavour was just okay, the portion was kind of small for the price. The spring rolls were nice and crispy but the filling wasn't as generous as I was expecting.The map tofu was a bit too salty for my taste and I'm surprised it didn't come with rice (I guess it would be extra).",got good; restaurant friendly; good got; good got; vietnamese good; good got; beef hot; good got; come wasn; vietnamese dong,3
Dong Phat,"When my family visited Paris, we stopped by this restaurant twice (on the same day). It was 15 minutes walk from the Eiffel tower. I would say this was comfort food to the soul for me. I am Vietnamese and I was impressed with some of the dishes we ordered the first time, which led us to come back for the next meal on the same day.My daughter had grilled pork with rice and it was amazing! They marinated the meat well, added lemongrass before the grilled which made it very tasty. My partner got rice in a hot stone with beef and egg. It was so good that I kept eating his. Mine was good too but the sauce on that dish was just incredible.There was a bit of a wait when we got in but not too long. Staff was nice and friendly. A plus point was the staff spoke English very well!Update to some of the reviews: THEY DO TAKE CREDIT CARDS",got good; restaurant friendly; good got; good got; vietnamese good; good got; beef hot; good got; come wasn; vietnamese dong,5

I recently visited this cozy little restaurant and was blown away by the delicious pho and lunch sets they had to offer.First up, the pho. We ordered the traditional beef pho and the broth was rich and flavorful, and the beef was tender. The noodles were perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of chewiness. We also ordered a beef rice bowl lunch set that came with a lychee dessert.Because the restaurant is pretty small, you may need to wait a bit. We stopped in for lunch and barely got a table.

Dong Phat,"After spending a drizzly morning touring the palace at Versailles, we were in the mood for soup. This small Vietnamese restaurant is a little off the beaten path, but not far from invalided where the dropped bus dropped us off after the tour.The food is authentic and not greasy. Their house made hot sauce is divine, and very hot. Like Thai Hot. The steam dumplings were pillowy and flavorful with soft (not chewy) shrimp. One order of the fried rice was not enough for my son, so he went back for seconds. And in their defense, it is a 7€ side dish. The prior reviews of beef with egg were spot on. It came with tender pieces of beef and a savory sauce. They provide a bottle of Sauce if you want to add some heat. The chicken pho came with lime wedge on the side but it wasn't necessary. The broth had a bright and fruity flavor and plenty of pieces of chicken.",got good; restaurant friendly; good got; good got; vietnamese good; good got; beef hot; good got; come wasn; vietnamese dong,5

The food--pho was spot on delicious with the broth so sumptuous, noodles not sticky but just perfectly made, the Bo luc lac was on point, very very good on each bite, and they even give you a complimentary lychee dessert.

This place is so efficient - once in line, we were probably seated within 10 minutes. We were seated outside and it was lovely, but they also have a full indoor restraint that was filled up.This place is a preset menu, with the only customer requests being beverage and how you want your steak cooked.Like clockwork, we were served a starter salad that was so light and refreshing. Immediately once finished, we received our steak frites covered in this magic sauce (no clue what's in it) but it was incredible. Wait staff didn't skip a beat, the minute you're running low on meat or frites they came by with ""refills"".Worth the wait - was incredible!",come paris; steak frites; waiting steak; steak fries; feel place; feel place; feel place; feel place; steak gravy; feel place,5

Luckily we are still able to get in first run.The service was actually very attentive and quite entertained.They only have one single menu with steak. And you only have medium and well done. They will divide the steak outside so you will feel you are in the some sort of camp waiting for food. They also would refill your streak and fries one more time. Overall. I like it.

Le Relais de l'Entrecôte,"What sets Le relays de l'Entrecôte apart is their dedication to perfection in a single dish--their famous steak! This restaurant has mastered the art of simplicity by focusing on a single dish since 1959. It's their signature steak accompanied by their secret sauce and a side of fries. Did I mention the fries are unlimited?!Though the line was long (1.5 hours to be exact), the moment I had my first bite of steak (medium rare of course) , I was done for! The meat was tender and infused with such a rich sauce, which created a symphony of taste ala Remy when he had the strawberry and cheese in Ratatouille.I created the perfect bite consisting of medium rare steak, crispy fries and then dredged it in that special sauce. Finish off that perfect bite with a sip of your red wine and you'll see fireworks!!For dessert we finished strong with a Vacherins- a dessert with meringues, vanilla ice cream, raspberry sorbet and topped with a raspberry coulis and chantilly cream. (I'm drooling just typing this)The ambiance is Persian with warm wood walls and vintage posters everywhere! So so cozy.

Then a plate of steak (already sliced), fries and gravy, followed. Fries were thin and crispy, steak was standard, and I like the gravy (I realized not everyone likes the gravy). When we thought we're done, our server came again replenishing our steak & frites!!They have quite a selection of desserts, but we were too full to try.Overall, worth a try, service was great, restaurant has that vintage-y Parisian feel.",come paris; steak frites; waiting steak; steak fries; feel place; feel place; feel place; feel place; steak gravy; feel place,4

The quality of steak is nothing special but the sauce is delicious and the fries are hot. That combined with the low price makes it a worth while meal.

Made the meal very filling.They give you the first half of steak and fries, then when done they give you the second half.I would def come again. They don't do reservations. We stood in line for an hour. I heard average is 1.5 hours. If it's just two people, you may be able to cut the line. Cause they will sometimes skip big parties and find two people to fill up space. Almost like single riders in a Disneyland ride.Crème brûlée: 4/5. Had to get some where it was invented. I liked semi smoking's probably from the way it was burned?

More than 70 people were waiting to get in after 9:30pm! After waiting anxiously for 45 mins and not much progress, a white flag was needed, much to my dismay. Thankfully the itinerary allowed for a visit the next day at noon, which upon arriving, just flabbergasted again by the impressive following of more than 30 waiting to get in so close to open.Unlike the night before however, I did make it in and the food is just delicious. The steak, the gravy, the steak frites....the seconds,.. In my group, everyone desired the same cooked to rare for their steak which made it easy on our server. The frites were crispy and better than the local McD's in the area. Now I will say the seasoning could have been a little and the salad was a little pedestrian but this was the quintessential experience I expected from steak frites in France.Our server might have been a little clumsy, but she was incredibly nimble her feet (the seating is very tight) and efficient, which was all I needed for a fantastic meal.

It is very small, with huge glass windows on the street side, and tempered blue walls on the interior. The decor is simple and clean, which is important for an establishment of such slight scale. The only eccentricity was a stuffed rooster perched on the bar who presided over the dining ceremonies with a watchful eye.The food was served on rustic mismatched plates of various styles and patterns. They reminded me of the kinds of treasures you might find at an antique broccante, or at your grandmother's house in the country.Starter #1: Hard boiled eggs with home-made patron was very proud of the mayonnaise and rightly so. What I couldn't heap on each egg half, I scooped up with baguette so as not to miss a single drop. Really flavorful, full-bodied mayo.Starter #2: baby burrito (which wasn't really that baby-sized at all) was served as a plump pouch, accompanied by lovely buttery salty toasts. The cheese itself was a little bland so the toasts served to enhance the flavor and provided a sturdy vehicle for the oozy inner cream of the burrata.Main #1: taking de boeuf didn't try the taking that my companion ordered so I can't make a comment. But judging from the hearty speed with which it was consumed, I'd say it went over well.Main #2: Salmon generous portion of quality salmon was dressed in a grainy mustard and dill vinaigrette, accompanied, quite surprisingly yet quite pleasantly, by a potato pure with a touch of nutmeg. The combination of textures and sweet and savory flavors made for a pleasant pairing. An improved spin on the usual fish and boiled potatoes duo.Dessert #1: Chocolate chocolate mousse was dense and creamy, and peppered with crispy cookie flakes. I felt like I was a kid again getting to lick the coveted brownie batter bowl.Dessert #2: Petit tangy sources of the fromage blanc was enhanced by a generous drizzling of sweet, smooth caramel.I should also mention the bathroom, which had bright white tiled walls and a fully assembled toilet (you never know in Paris) and proper paper towels. I really must have been here too long if I think a toilet seat and paper towels are the epitome of luxury.As any new restaurant owner, the patron of Le Tout Petit comforted himself with an endearing self consciousness about his fledgling business.

Ober Mamma,"Chaotic, in all the best ways.This place came highly recommended by numerous people, one of whom used to live in the city. My friend in Japan even sent me a video review from IG. I was instantly sold.We came in for dinner after spending the whole day biking around Versailles. We were tired and starving. I decided to take a chance and pull up without a reservation because from what I read online you can usually walk in and wait for a table and we were down to wait for food. There were a couple of guys ahead of us, but they suddenly walked away when the hostess came out to help so all if a sudden we were at the front of the line. Fortunately for us, there was a table available, but it was only available for an hour and 20 minutes as it was needed for a reservation. Being the American eaters that we are, all we really needed was an hour so we got seated instantly.We started off with a drink and the burrito that came with a basket of bread. We cleared that serving real quick. Well, to be honest, it was all me, but no one was keeping track. I got a pizza and my friend got the most popular pasta - the truffle. We both ate everything. I only ate the middle of the pizza and left the outside crust because I'm a savage. My dinner companion is not much of an eater as I am so she was done with no room for dessert. I always make room for dessert so I got the pineapple one. I love passion fruit but I didn't care too much for it mixed with piña. They didn't go together. Despite that, we had an amazing dinner.The service was above and beyond. It truly was chaotic in there. The tables were so close together, but somehow all the servers managed to go from point a to i to i without bumping into anyone. I was so amazed and impressed at the same time. It looked fully booked the whole night as we never saw an empty table. I have it to give a special shout out to the woman who dropped by our table numerous times. Not only did she speak French and Italian, but she said she also spoke Arabic as she was from Morocco. The way she seamlessly transitioned between the languages was so smooth. I could only wish to have the ability to be a polyglot.I totally get the appeal of this place. There's a reason why they stay booked and busy. Tasty drinks, delicious food and prime people watching. It's one of the few places in Paris where you hear English as the language spoken by the majority of the patrons.I'll be back in a few months, but I'm going to holler at the Pink location.",pizza good; pizza good; pizza good; pasta atmosphere; came table; pizza definitely; truffle came; pizza good; pasta bit; pizza good,5
Ober Mamma,"I tried to get a reservation at Pink Mamma, but was unsuccessful, so I decided to try over Mamma instead. I'm so glad I did because we had an amazing meal! The cocktails were all super tasty, and I loved the glass mine came in! We shared a pizza and a pasta, and they were both great! The pasta was definitely the star, and the pizza could have been better. We ordered the pizza that had anchovies and different types of pork, but it hardly had any cheese, hardly had any pork, and literally had like three anchovies. Luckily it was still good, but it wasn't really what we were expecting. It also wasn't cut (at all) which was a bit annoying, but nbd. The service was great and the restaurant is beautiful and so unique.

Ober Mamma,"Incredible Italian food in Paris )which I didn't expect)! Definitely make a reservation at least 2 weeks out.We started with the red onion and balsamic tart that I couldn't get enough of. I will say you must really like red onions to enjoy it though. We also had the ceviche cod tacos and they were ehh. The cocktails were also great and the gin drink I ordered was HUGE for the price and I definitely left a little tipsy after just one. Our entrees were amazing though. I had the ""famous"" (I've heard so much about it by word of mouth) truffle pasta and wow it wasn't at all. I ate it all somehow even though I was so full. My fiance had the margherita pizza and it was perfect - super thin, bubbly crust - my favorite type of pizza. We had to do dessert too. The pistachio tiramisu was good, not great. Along with the ceviche this was in last place but still by no means bad. I just prefer more espresso forward tiramisu.If I'm back in Paris I'll try another Big Mamma restaurant group spot again for sure.",pizza good; pizza good; pizza good; pasta atmosphere; came table; pizza definitely; truffle came; pizza good; pasta bit; pizza good,4

Our server was super nice and spoke to us in English. My friend tried to order a pesto pasta dish, but it was no longer present on the menu. The server recommended the truffle pasta I was about to order -- which turned out to be a bit bland, but I still really enjoyed it. I had never had a pasta noodle like that before and it really added to the dish. My friend thought it tasted just like cream of mushroom. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and we're delightfully surprised at how AMAZING it was! A bit sweet, but still the BEST tiramisu I've ever had.",pizza good; pizza good; pizza good; pasta atmosphere; came table; pizza definitely; truffle came; pizza good; pasta bit; pizza good,4
Zébulon,"Menu in the pictures. Advice from one American to anyone visiting Paris, France, this is a jewel you shouldn't overlook.It's not far from the Louvre museum. It is not where most of the restaurants are and that made it a nice quiet evening. My wife found this on Google on a Monday night. We had no reservations at 6:45 and got in without issues. If you are without reservations, it is worth asking if they have space. The space can be limited if you have larger group. For two people, it's relatively easier.First of all, our server was absolutely incredible. A perfect representation of the restaurant. He spoke English very well and answered all questions about the dishes. This made it very easy to decide what to get and avoid food allergies. I wish I could remember his name. He's a younger guy.Most of the dishes are uniquely flavored and delicious. They are smaller portions but really are worth the price. You are going to enjoy the experience with the smaller crowd. (I can honestly justify the cost simply with the square footage you get here compared to other restaurants in town. You get plenty of elbow room.)Plus, The chefs are really good at their jobs. Everything was perfectly cooked and well presented.The only caveat, I cannot suggest the rabbit stuffed Ravioli unless you like smoked fish. The smoke fish overwhelmed the rabbit dish and invaded my burps the rest of the night.",great dishes; lunch restaurant; great dishes; dishes fish; menu tasting; did crab; lamb wonderful; food good; great dishes; great dishes,5

Zébulon,"My wife and I ate at on a trip to Paris. It wasn't far from our hotel and was on the Michelin Guide website. Wow did this place taste fantastic! The wait staff were great and spoke English very well. The restaurant itself was very beautiful and modern. We started off the night splitting oxtail bao and crab tartlets. The bao can in a traditional steam box and the crab in the shell of a spider crab and a bed of raw nuts and such. Both were delicious.For our main I ordered fried lamb sweetbreads and she got scallops from the Seine. While a small main course, it was nonetheless tasty.For dessert we both had different experiences. We're in a new city, let's try something different. My wife ordered carrot cake, which came with glazed carrots on top of the cake and a carrot sorbet. While the cake was good, she did not like the sorbets. For me, I ordered The Hay. This had a chocolate tart and hay-infused ice cream. The chocolate was very good, the hay ice cream did not meet the mark.

Both were terrific, but the guinea fowl was amazingly tender and delicious, and was both our favorites.For mains we had the roasted lamb and the veal. Both were also wonderful, but our favorite was the lamb dish, as it was the most tender and flavorful lamb I have had in years.For dessert we both had the Coffee-chocolate​ cream with banana sorbet, on an almond bisquet, with shaved cocoanut.

Those are all the words I can muster, the rest is all my mouth watering over the thought.I didn't come to Paris to eat a burger. As I listened to our slightly condescending server explain a few menu items, I still knew this was no ordinary burger and I must have it! This inventive burger was married with blood sausage, an ingredient that elevated the taste and texture and was topped with caramelized onion and cheese.Dessert. If I had to give it a name, it would be Clouds & Sunshine. A little tower of slightly sweet baked egg whites, not yet a meringue, still a light & fluffy texture, surrounded by a pureed pool of...oh gosh, I think it was passion fruit!Service, efficient and prompt.

Le Pas Sage,"Finding a restaurant in Paris was easy. Finding a GOOD restaurant in Paris was actually pretty easy, too, after getting off of the main streets and away from tourist areas. The wife and I were in the neighborhood and decided Le Pas Sage looked promising. Oh, how right we were! Le Pas Sage served up traditional French bistro fare made with fresh ingredients and a modern, upscale presentation in a very casual setting. It was located on what can only be described as a fairly busy but seedy side street/alley replete with several sex shops up and down the street from it. However, we weren't deterred by the colorful neighborhood, which only added to quirky charm of our experience. The weather was perfect, so we sat at one of its handful of tables set up outside.The menu was small, but listed some interesting, if not delicious, offerings. We decided to go the 3-course prix fixe route (39€/person). Our meal started off with a delicious amuse (a small bisque whose ingredients I don't recall). I had the Tartare de but topped with foie gras and fresh herbs. The foie gras atop the tartare was a beautifully sinful indulgence, but the brightly colored fresh herbs gave the dish a wonderful flavor, aromatic, and color contrast that put it over the top. The wife and I decided on the cute de but (12€ supplement/person) for our main course. Talk about a meat-lovers wet dream! It was over 2 labs of beefy goodness served on a cutting board with grilled tomatoes and also bone marrow. I love marrow! The rib steak was prepared bone-in (the bone was removed for service), nicely seasoned, and cooked perfectly to the Chef's recommended medium rare. We accompanied our food with a 2011 Jean-Luc combo corns Les torres Brulees, a full-bodied sarah that complemented the juicy, meaty cute de but amazingly well. For dessert, I had the Soupe de fruits, a pleasant, not too sweet, end to my meal with its assortment of fruits and sorbet served in a fruit gelée.Le Pas Sage served up a tremendous meal! Considering what we had and its quality beginning-to-end, it was also surprisingly reasonable. Service was friendly and solid throughout. Le Pas Sage was truly enjoyable and a place I would gladly return.",good menu; dish great; burger texture; menu waiter; menu food; responsible food; dish meat; served pas; menu food; menu food,5
Le Pas Sage,"I want to give this 3.5 stars. Service was friendly. Reservations recommended. We went on a friend's recommendation on a weekend night, and she generously called ahead to make sure they saved us a table when many places seem to be booked solid. (We didn't know that most restaurants here will save a reserved table for the entire evening, which is great if you're running 30-60' late, but not ideal if you're hungry and wandering around without plans.)* The boeuf wrapped in cabbage dish is a must-have.* The Saint-Jacques were great but the cream sauce was not.* We also had an boeuf porch as entree (appetizer), which was sort of reminiscent of dim sum, served with a crunchy bird's-nest type thing. This was probably my favorite dish since it was such a great mix of East and French.They missed one of the things I ordered, but I was ordering in French and I've had it happen to me enough times in English to know that it just happens sometimes that a dish isn't written down or gets forgotten (at least we weren't charged for it).They also brought a small amuse-bouche, which was some sort of creamed corn with cheddar cheese at the bottom. That was quite tasty, although I'm not sure cheddar was the right cheese to choose, my partner loved it.",good menu; dish great; burger texture; menu waiter; menu food; responsible food; dish meat; served pas; menu food; menu food,4

Le Pas Sage,"I have mixed feelings about this place.On the one hand, it was really good - and every dish was pretty surprising. You can see that the chef loves cooking, and that he takes dressing as seriously as Masterchef contestants do. (An egg-based cream with mushrooms served in an eggshell, in a grass nest? You got it!) Take the €39 3-course dinner menu, and prepare to be delighted. There are only 2 options per course, but try them all, you might have phenomenal surprises (including the pain perdu with red wine sauce - INCREDIBLE).On the other hand, it was a bit empty when we went, there was not enough light (dim is romantic, dark makes eating difficult) and the service was not as good as the cuisine. We had to holler for more water, and the waiters put the dishes on our table without telling us what was in them (which is a shame when it's that elaborate!!)Overall, some small steps and they'll be ready for a 5th star",good menu; dish great; burger texture; menu waiter; menu food; responsible food; dish meat; served pas; menu food; menu food,4
Le Pas Sage,"My new favorite ""cozy"" restaurant. The food is good, just enough flair without feeling too stuffy or over the top. The setting is cute too; in fact this entire passage is filled with cute stores. They have a rather long wine list for ""wine by the glass"" which is good if you can't finish a whole bottle. It seems to be a popular place for lunch among those working in the area. I'd suggest coming here for dinner on a Friday night (as opposed to Saturday where it can get crowded.) The food menu doesn't give you a crazy amount of choice; it has 2-3 choices per course. But they all looked good!

Le Louchébem,"Delicious Filet Steak in a traditional Parisian setting:We went for a late dinner with a very big group of friends (we had made reservations in advance), early on in the week. Service was pretty fast and delightful. We started off with some places to share. I would have liked more pickles on it and as I am not generally a fan of cold cuts and white baguette bread, I did prefer the goat cheese we had near the end of our meal.I had ordered the filet steak for the main dish, medium. The meat was very tasty, soft on the inside and nicely grilled on the outside. The sides, potatoes and green beans, were ok. I had asked for an alternative, but you cannot expect special service and particularly healthy options in a traditional French restaurant in the Les halls area. So I made do with what they had paired the meat with. I think all the meat dishes come with a selection of sauces - or maybe we got all of them as we were so many.I really liked the onion sauce.For dessert, I had ordered the cafe gourmand. I was pleasantly surprised to find that one of the three accompanying patisserie was an 'Ile Flottant' (a soft meringue floating in a vanilla custard sauce). One of my friends had the creme brulee and I did steal a spoonful, it was quite yummy. Most of us had ordered the chocolate profiteroles. That portion looked so huge (three profiteroles with vanilla ice-cream), it could serve as a whole meal. . .If you are looking for a very French restaurant experience and you are hungry, especially if you wish to eat meat, this is definitely a place to go to. There are, however, many similar restaurants, even within walking distance - so it depends on what area you like best and what price-range you are looking for (I prefer smaller spots in different areas of Paris).

He suggested the right compliments to help make everything go together perfectly.Escargots in the shell is always a good thing. There's is perfect and enjoyed with the pieces of baguette. The rib steak was cooked perfectly and had the most amazing crust but still so tender. Frites were crispy (my preference) and green beans.I didn't get a picture of the creme brulee at the end because it was devoted before I knew it. I'll assure you that the custard was silky smooth with the right hint of vanilla and the brulee crust not to overwhelming.

BEST MEAL MY WIFE HAD IN PARIS (for me definitely in my top three but it's tough to pick one).The host/slash server who didn't smile at all (but that was okay with me) sat us down right away out front (we love to sit outside, especially on a pleasant sunny day).He didn't speak any English -- but we usually take that as an EXCELLENT SIGN, figuring the place is probably less touristy.We had a first course which was tamponade on toasted bread, which was tasty. But then! Next came my entree (or appetizer as we non-French say) which was a beautiful gourmet setup of pate with what tasted like garlic mashed potatoes and some balsamic drizzle. The plate looked like a work of art fit for the Louvre! I mean look at my picture! It tasted fantastic.For the main course I had chicken which was served with cous-cous in a pot with some peppers and it was excellent.My wife ordered the duck breast which was OUT OF THIS WORLD INCREDIBLE, I MEAN AH-freakin'-MAAAAZING...!!! One of the best meals we have ever had in our entire lives... I mean this you have to try... It's definitely work finding this place.Oh, and check out the inside, too.

Caramel flan and fruit, along with the yogurt ice cream with mango pure was mouthwatering. The Escargot and breaded shrimp salad was a awesome. The service was superb and the waitress always had an eye out for anything we needed. At other restaurants I've realized that some of the waiters would get upset and frustrated when I did not speak French very well, but here, she understood that we were tourists, and she tried her best to help us.

As we approached the counter we asked for an English menu. They were patient with us while we ordered and we got the spinach, lamb and potato wraps for 3 of us. Luckily for us the limited seating opened up at that time for us. It was fanatic to observe the operations on a very busy night and how great everyone was with the customers on a very hot Paris evening. We got our food and it was hot and just delicious.

Chez le Libanais,"During a visit to Paris years ago, I was astounded by the manatees prepared at the takeout window at Chez le Libanais. Returning years later, I finally got to go to their sit down restaurant across the street, where I ordered the mezzo set menu for two. These small plates are my favorite way to share a Lebanese meal, because you get to try out so many different dishes and dips. The set menu came with five cold mezzes, eight pastries/fritters, and one warm dish. The fezzes included a creamy, lemon hummus, baba ganoush (eggplant purged with tahini), tabbouleh, (puréed rice and lentils topped with fried onions), and (crumbled cheese mixed with parsley and topped with tomatoes). The plate of ""beignets"" included two pastries filled with ground meat, two pastries with spinach, two turnovers filled with meat, and two donut-shaped falafel with traitor sauce (tahini and lemon juice). And finally, the hot dish was made with chicken wings and brunettes in a savory spiced sauce. All of the dishes went nicely with the basket of thin pita bread and a dollop of the housemate chili sauce. While everything was tasty and the service was friendly, the prices were definitely high for the quality of the dishes. If I had to choose between the takeout window and the sit-down restaurant, I'd stick with the more casual option.",shawarma try; dishes sauce; excellent lebanese; falafel 10; took corner; took corner; took corner; place wraps; took corner; food delicious,4

BUT, I expect far more from middle eastern restaurants given the much wider and more delicious flavor profile. The restaurant also forces you to order at least two starters per head.

It took little while for our food to come out. Worth the wait!! The shawarma was soooo good. The meat was seasoned perfectly. The sauce was on point. I loved every bite! This shawarma wasn't as good as the one from my childhood, but it was super close. Definitely closer than any shawarma I've had in the US. The baklava was also pretty tasty.My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this quick and inexpensive meal.

Au Vieux Comptoir,"Based on the recommendation of a friend who is a native Parisian, my wife and I booked a reservation at Au Vieux compton on a recent visit to Paris. It is located in the Latin Quarter, quite close to many of the popular tourist venues. But, the patrons were nearly all local, probably as a reservation is needed. We were offered a choice of seating, either at a window sable for two or, alternatively, at a larger shared table in the middle of the restaurant. We sat at the latter, and had great company with some regulars who split their time between Paris, Spain and the Middle East. The staff was super friendly, the food was traditional Parisian and we had a great meal and time during our dinner. We ordered the platter of foie gras as starter. I've really never had it before so I wasn't sure how it would be presented. But it came as a sliced pate with aspic to hold it together. I guess I thought it would be creamy and smooth but it was a more hearty presentation that went nicely with the bread. Our host, the owner, suggested a nice white wine from a friends vineyard and we were happy to give it a shot. It was a very nice and light white blend.For our main courses, my wife went for a tasty cod over fresh fave dinner while I took a risk and tried something completely new that I'd never seen in the USA, kidneys in a Dijon sauce. I'm always one to try out unique dishes. This one had a really rich Dijon sauce which helped blend with the strong kidney flavor, which is a bit like liver. I was happy I gave it a try, even the locals were impressed.I'd recommend Au Vieux compton as a nice choice for a local feel in the heart of Paris. Just make sure you make a reservation first.

We had been searching and searching for an authentic, unpretentious and lively meal for four days - to find it by happy surprise on our last day. The charm of the exterior - not overly crowded or shrouded by smoke like the rest of the surrounding bistro - pulled us in after we saw beef and duck on the menu. The sommelier is a lovely, welcoming woman married to the chef. Everyone walking by noted how cute it was. Wonderful wine selection and all was reasonably priced. One appetizer (entree), two main courses (plats), one dessert, and a bottle of wine and coffee = 110€. Will be back for sure.",prices reasonable; prices reasonable; food paris; prices reasonable; dish wonderful; paris dinner; vibe prices; prices reasonable; prices reasonable; star granted,5

Not an inexpensive place to eat, but by far the best food we had in Paris.Had the foie gras and buffalo mozzarella with pesto gelato to start. The ""cheese"" was like an airy cloud of deliciousness. Combined with the pesto, heavenly.All of our dishes were great, but my daughter had the beef bourguignon which was the best I've ever had.Four people for 200€ , but we had a decent bottle of wine and I'd say it was worth the money considering how much it costs to eat out in Paris.",prices reasonable; prices reasonable; food paris; prices reasonable; dish wonderful; paris dinner; vibe prices; prices reasonable; prices reasonable; star granted,5

Au Vieux Comptoir,"Having had a host of experiences that were just 'okay', I was looking forward to a proper night out on my most recent trip to Paris. Thanks to some excellent service and good food, Au Vieux compton provided just that.Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?While arc is typically packed to the gills, I was pleased to find that my friend and I were seated immediately as we showed up roughly 30-45 minutes prior to closing. Was the server a bit grumpy? Yes, but it didn't take away from his professional attitude, and I respect that. The atmosphere is a great mix of in and outdoor seating, which is perfect weather permitting, and the cafe-style setting is authentically Parisian. Star Granted.Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?If I've said it once I've said it a thousand times: Paris is expensive, but I was pleased to find that my Mushroom Risotto clocked in at only €12.00 for a dinner portion. Have a look:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KqswWXUct-mL5666TmXlag&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHgThat's fair and balanced folks. Star Granted.Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?I love; love love love, the hell out of Risotto. It's my go-to for Italian, and as a result I'll admit that I'm pretty damn critical of the dish. While good, this wasn't the best risotto I've ever had, and I'll go ahead and chalk that up to having it a bit overcooked and thus a bit 'mushy'. However, the flavor was nice and I didn't walk away disappointed. Single Star Granted.Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?I would without hesitation go back to Au Vieux compton in the near future, but I can't say it's among my favorite restaurants in Paris.

Le Mazenay,"I really wanted to like this place. However, the meal really fell short of expectations. The first course - snails, was a miss. Basically a few snails on shortbread with creme fraiche and some greens - very uninspired and nothing notable. The second course - partridge, had no sauce, no seasoning and no starch. That is not an exaggeration - it had no sauce and no seasoning and definitely no salt. For €34 for just the main course, it was extremely overpriced for Paris. The cheese course was great, but to be frank, it was the only course that wasn't prepared in house. For the 4 of us dinner came out to ~€240 which again, is top of the market for non Michelin starred restaurants in Paris.

We would call it ""farm to table,"" but France has been doing farm to table cooking for centuries. The team here has figured out how to source the best ingredients in France and present them to you in a delightful and non-pretentious way. The bread made my wife cry it was so good... The cheese was so incredibly pure that we came back five times in the same week for dinner. Do yourself a favor and book in advance, let them take care of you and allow yourself to get lost in the best France has to offer. Also, if you call ahead they will decant your wine for you through the leading up to dinner...

We (husband, 14 year old son and I) had a very good meal at what felt like a high-end, neighborhood restaurant, but with food that could rival the best. The choices were limited, but understandable in a small restaurant. There were 4 appetizer and 4 entree choices. The pate was excellent (one of the best we've had) and each entree (fish, chicken and filet) were all prepared to perfection and unique.

Most importantly, he is deeply committed to providing the very highest level of cooking, using local ingredients, artisanal breads, cheeses, and traditional recipes.My wife and I had Boeuf Bourguignon - a classic, and the duck breast.

Le Black Dog,"Not sure that the famous gastronomic chroniclers of the chic Saint-Germain-des-Près district ventured much into this cutthroat-like cave, whose facade, and few sinister terrace smokers, would make run to mother's skirts all good Kitty of the 16th arrondissement. Unless slumming.Enough mumbo jumbo. What do we eat?!!!Black poodle in a hot dog? Maybe when the restaurant opened. Today, we are with sublime pieces of Argentine meat, cooked to perfection (if your request is such), i.e., not exceeding the rare. Beyond that, confers the particulars mentioned above. They will teach you how to live.The nicknames of the dishes are in keeping with the atmosphere of the place, juggling between the limo Erectus, the death penalty, the metal machine, or the Valhalla.Of course, you have some dishes that will only arouse the enthusiasm of the most loyal of Michael bubble or Barry Manilow, such as grilled chicken or vegan meatballs. Let's be clear, not the best on the menu.So yes, in short, the meats are superb in terms of quality and cooking. You feel that both the service and the kitchen light a candle in your memory when you ask for ""rare"" cooked meat. This one will be served to you cooked on the surface without being charred and hot inside. So no complaints.On the side a wide choice of various sauces at 1 euro each. There will always be a war between those who consider that it should be included in the price and those who think the diversity of the six sauces justifies the supplement. I'll consider doing a thesis on this...Am I dithyrambic? Well, let's say the desserts are a little ""special"". The only one out of the ordinary is ""alien eggs"". And we're more into the fun stuff than the end-of-meal happiness. These are fried dough with a cream that is unlikely to be used in gastronomy. With a pretty caramel pentagram...Plus a little whipped cream. Come on; we'll forgive you by saying it's for fun...Very good maybe Argentinian fraiche to accompany all this.There is still the scene...I put the almost maximum score on this point because I love it.

Le Black Dog,"This is from our visit in March 2018.We didn't have reservations so we got in line early for a dinner table. We were the first two in line so when the doors opened at 8 - we were able to get a small table. The restaurant is located behind the bar and is very small - it seats only 20-30 people. However, if you're craving steak in Paris - it's probably one of the best Argentine steakhouse around. The theme is very Heavy Metal and the menu has a lot of sexual innuendos so if you're rather conservative then you might have a problem but then again you probably won't be staying on this side of the city.The service was excellent - we had one waitress for the entire room but she was on top of everything! Best service we had for our entire Paris trip! The food was decent - not the best steak but not the worst. The portions on the steak were small but the portion size for the potatoes was huge. Make sure to get the extra sauce assortment and try them all with both the steak and potatoes. I ordered a chicken salad which came a little too drenched in dressing - not sure if that was normal or they thought I'd like it that way being from the states. Creme brulee was decent. We also ordered empanadas as an appetizer - they resembled a pair of testicles - we got a kick out of that!In summary, decent food (maybe a little $$ for the quality) but the service was excellent and the theme was entertaining - heavy metal and sex. We bought a t-shirt to remember our night.",metal good; young kids; restaurant food; metal area; paris visit; restaurant food; cooked ll; steak service; restaurant food; paris friendly,5

Writing this review as it's been almost a year since my visit and I miss Paris now more than ever.If you come and there's a large crowd, they let people in at groups at a time. You can find books of all kinds here. It's my tradition to buy a book in a bookshop while on vacation and I ended up getting a special version of ""The Little Prince"" which they had several different versions of. I also ended up getting a tote (which I use almost every day), bookmarks, and a postcard.

We went within an hour or so of closing time and luckily it wasn't too bad. It was extremely organized and the line moved quick.Upon entering, there are two floors and you're not permitted to take photos inside. Outside is no problem, but inside given the amount of people and even the cozy reading corner, well, I can see their point.They sell books in English and French. The staff, too, is fully bilingual and speaks both languages with ease.

Shakespeare and Company,"Shakespeare & Company has been around, in one form or another, for over one hundred years. During that time, it has become a major draw for almost every English speaking in Paris.The history goes back to Silvia Beach pre-WWII bookstore, which became the famous hangout for the likes of Gertrude Stein, Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, among others.In the post war years, American George Whitman re-opened the bookstore here on the Left Bank and drew a more bohemian crowd of Allen Ginsburg, ana's Nin, James Baldwin, Richard Wright and George Plimpton, who at the time was editing The Paris Review.There's a lot of history here and there seems to be a party whenever I stop by, either while waiting in line and getting to know the folks in the queue, or after one's purchase, sitting in a nearby Café.As I said, it does feel party or that the carnival has come to town. Of course, isn't that the Latin Quarter's appeal?Now where did I put my Stephen Clarke book: ""1,000 Years of Annoying the French"", which I just purchased? LOL.

However, the wait wasn't too long and the line goes quickly. They don't allow pictures inside the bookstore. Inside the bookstore, they have books both in English and in other languages. Prices are also super fair. If you end up purchasing a book, they also ask if you want their store stamp inside the book which I love!

Hey, maybe this is the beginning to my yelp reviewing career. Support me on patron soon!Anyway, this place is great in location, atmosphere, and food. It being in Paris, the dishes are great and subtly flavored. They work really well with the wine that's provided, I don't recall the name of the wine (that's not my forte) but it mixed really well with the pork chop and cake served on the menu when I went. The restaurant is situated away from the streets and rests inside an arcade gallery nearby the Louvre. So it's not the easiest to find, and I was extremely lucky to stumble upon it when trying to escape the rain. You can still sit outside in the arcade and never have to worry about getting wet.The service was prompt and friendly as well, which added to the pleasant ambiance.What I really loved about it was that, as a restaurant, it painted the romantic image of Paris that the city is so well known for. But there isn't that sense of the place being a tourist trap, like all the places around the Eiffel Tower. I'm not saying this is where the locals go, but it sits away from all the other tourists and noise of the city. In other words, the place feels like an oasis.",meal restaurant; food worth; restaurant tiny; restaurant tiny; restaurant tiny; french meal; restaurant tiny; really place; restaurant tiny; restaurant tiny,5

L'Ange 20,"My wife and I were here on our last night in Paris and this place stunned us with how amazing it was. Small, quaint place that allows you to peak in the kitchen while your meal is prepared. We didn't have a reservation, but they sat us right next to the bar right away. Nicholas ( I believe was our server) was super friendly and helped us right away. My wife knew she wanted the risotto, I was up in the air over the lamb or the duck. He said without question to get the lamb, and was he ever right. The flavors of the meat were impeccable. There was a nice pepper corn finish on top of the meat that was a terrific accent. There was a sauce underneath the vegetables that I could drink up. The only thing bad about the dish was that I finished it too soon. My wife couldn't stop raving about the risotto, and so I tried it and I could have easily stolen her dish from here and finished it. There was so much mushroom flavor! Then there was the deserts. Just leave room. This place was super local, very welcoming, and we've already decided that when we come back to Paris we are coming back here for the rest of the menu.",food service; food service; food delicious; paris wife; food service; food service; great spot; food service; great amazing; staff kitchen,5
L'Ange 20,"Last night in Paris we came her for dinner. Before you go call and make a reservation!!!Such a great dining experience, very small place so the interior is warm. The design is awesome! Wine boxes all over the walls and old magazine pages made into a wall paper. Very modern and hip with some classic pieces throughout.My aunt and uncle have been coming here since it was in the original location. Both the chef/owner and waiter (related to the owner) knew them and said hi.Food was amazing, semi open kitchen where you can see everything being made. I got the angel hair pasta encrusted shrimp with guacamole for my starter and chicken with gnocchi for my main. We ended with a warm milk and white chocolate cake and fruit tart for dessert. Everything was amazing.We started with champagne, had a bottle of red and they gave us a complimentary dessert wine that paired with what we got. Not sure if that the norm or if it was because it was my birthday.",food service; food service; food delicious; paris wife; food service; food service; great spot; food service; great amazing; staff kitchen,5

The Grilled Wild Cod Fillet was served over white rice and vegetables and was on the bland side, but came with a super flavor coconut milk curry sauce.But my favorite dishes here were definitely the Steak Tartare of raw minced aura beef, mixed with capers, onions, and other seasonings; and the Confit Duck Leg, a super tender duck leg with crispy skin--their house specialty!

The onion soup is not the best I've had in France like the bread was soggy portions were small. I got the fake duck confit as part of the set menu but it was looked very mid especially the side dishes of the orange mashed potato and the starter of the toast with crime de salmon. Very weird and could've gotten the same for like 3 euro at Franprix.Beware of the bottle vs. 50ml carafe of wine difference on the menu -- the font is very small and cannot be discerned.

Les Philosophes,"A group of us tried Les philosopher after one of us saw it on YouTube. It was a great find.I give Les Philosophes5 stars because they stand out above other Parisian Brasseries. The food was well above average and the service was attentive and friendly. It was not your usual tourist trap close restaurant. I really appreciated their more eclectic menu, an obvious concern for quality, and general vibe. One basic plus is that their outdoor seating is not right next to a major road, so there was very little car noise.Another plus is their wider wine selection. They also serve 50 al carafe instead of just by the glass or bottle, which was a nice change.

Les Philosophes,"Les philosopher is a cafe and brasserie with classic French cuisine and a few global influences on the menu. Our server here was super enthusiastic and friendly and made sure we had a great time! To start, we had the French onion soup, a savory, umami beef broth with caramelized onions, topped with croutons with melted Comte cheese on top. For our mains, the Les philosopher salad came with lots of mixed vegetables (lettuce, greens, radicchio, endive, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, radishes, watermelon, avocado), slices of smoked duck breast, path Negra ballot ham, and toasted sourdough bread topped with generous rounds of creamy goat cheese. The Grilled Wild Cod Fillet was served over white rice and vegetables and was on the bland side, but came with a super flavor coconut milk curry sauce.But my favorite dishes here were definitely the Steak Tartare of raw minced aura beef, mixed with capers, onions, and other seasonings; and the Confit Duck Leg, a super tender duck leg with crispy skin--their house specialty! The meat was flavorful and came right off the bone, and the crispy skin was the kicker.

The onion soup is not the best I've had in France like the bread was soggy portions were small. I got the fake duck confit as part of the set menu but it was looked very mid especially the side dishes of the orange mashed potato and the starter of the toast with crime de salmon. Very weird and could've gotten the same for like 3 euro at Franprix.Beware of the bottle vs. 50ml carafe of wine difference on the menu -- the font is very small and cannot be discerned.

Les Philosophes,"A group of us tried Les philosopher after one of us saw it on YouTube. It was a great find.I give Les Philosophes5 stars because they stand out above other Parisian Brasseries. The food was well above average and the service was attentive and friendly. It was not your usual tourist trap close restaurant. I really appreciated their more eclectic menu, an obvious concern for quality, and general vibe. One basic plus is that their outdoor seating is not right next to a major road, so there was very little car noise.Another plus is their wider wine selection. They also serve 50 al carafe instead of just by the glass or bottle, which was a nice change.

Chez Janou,"I had spent the morning contemplating modern art. During a two-week stint in Paris, I ended up at the ever fascinating Centre Pompidou, a museum I admire deeply and yet at the same time a museum by which I often find myself feeling incomprehensible drained. As I descended the building's trademark transparent escalators back down into the bustle of Les Halles, I knew that there was only one thing that could revive me in that moment: an ungodly amount of chocolate mousse.Luckily, I was just a short walk away from the heart of the Marais, where Chez janos sits poised on a corner beneath a green and white striped awning. The first word that comes to mind upon setting eyes on the place is ""darling,"" although passing through the heavy doors gives way to a whole new landscape of vocabulary -- hip, timeless, quirky, and indisputably cool. (Cool here being pronounced with a French accent, of course.) The walls are tastefully cluttered with colorful remnants of a Parisian past, and exploring them feels almost like going backwards and forwards in time all at once.If there's a way for a restaurant to win my heart from the get-go, it's a solid welcome. Sometimes that comes in the form of a friendly host or a fun ritual about finding your table. Other times -- and oftentimes -- it comes in the form of olives. From to (a personal favorite), a small bowl of olives feels to me a lot like an olive branch itself -- it is a predictor of peace, an indication of community, and a signal of good things to come. Of course, this little snack to whet my appetite also happened to be a perfectly savory complement to the undeniably sweet dish my dining companion and I had come for: the establishment's famed chocolate mousse.As anyone who has passed through the doors of Chez janos knows, however, this is no ordinary chocolate mousse. It does not come served in a sweet little ramen garnished with berries and and shaved chocolate or powdered sugar, most certainly not. Instead, it is brought to the table in a mammoth ceramic dish, having almost the appearance of a teacup on steroids. A massive scoop is then procured from the cavernous vessel and ceremoniously flopped over onto a plate to be shared, savored, and lauded by all. When our server asked if we'd like a second scoop, he quickly added ""no waste!"" A man after my own heart. (And he was right, of course -- one scoop for the two of us most definitely did the trick.)I was only more smitten when I saw the adorable signature Chez janos nougat sitting innocently beside my companion's cappuccino, and again when I tucked one of their precious takeaway cards in my wallet. (Another way to win me over -- give me a mini postcard at the end of the meal, and the deal is sealed.) The restaurant was so proud of this special little world it had created, and by association, I had become so too.Chez janos is a delightful time capsule into the Paris of yesterday, infused with the flavors and the flair of the modern-day city of love. You'll find more than just an impeccable cure to your sweet tooth -- you'll also find kindness, camaraderie, and an infectious that's far more important than anything that could be plated.Read more reviews at letsgetdinner8.wordpress.com.",feels food; janos chez; make janos; dessert food; food paris; perfect lovely; dessert food; good time; closed restaurant; good came,5

We both enjoyed them!For the main course, I had an outstanding meal of grilled lamb chops with pepper sauce and grilled young vegetables. A lovely presentation!My husband raved about the roasted duck breast with raspberry sauce and a tian of vegetables. Very tender and flavorful.Of course we had to try their desserts!

The hostess/waitress was very attentive and although we did not speak French, she helped us with our selections and offered wine suggestions as well. Nothing is rushed, all food is cooked to order and the atmosphere is relaxed. My husband experienced frogs legs for the first time! They were tasty and moist.....not overdone. We both enjoyed them!For the main course, I had an outstanding meal of grilled lamb chops with pepper sauce and grilled young vegetables. A lovely presentation!My husband raved about the roasted duck breast with raspberry sauce and a tian of vegetables. Very tender and flavorful.Of course we had to try their desserts! He had the chocolate mousse, very yummy. But mine was the best! A sampling of mini versions of main desserts.....crime brûlée, chocolate mousse and a strawberry cheesecake!!

Le Petit Marché,"Completely disagree with some of these helpers who claim they are rude to Americans. Quite the contrary. We arrived kinda late on a Sunday night, tired and hungry from traveling. They gave us a prime table out front. The only problem is, the Parisian way is to smoke and eat. We were seated 6 inches away from a table of 4 young French guys all chain smoking. We politely asked to move inside and they were super gracious and let us choose a table. It was still very hot out and the inside was hot as well. We asked them if we could change tables a 2nd time and the manager was so kind, he went out of his way to clear a table outside at the very end, super far away from the smoking. Then, the food was outstanding (especially since it was simply a corner bistro). We have the seared duck. Delicious. Again they could not have more kind and accommodating to us, they even brought us a bottle of melon liquor at the end of the meal, poured us a shot each and told us to drink as much as we like & left the bottle! Just try being nice to people from the start and they will likely return the kindness.

I did not taste any citrus nor did I see any tomatoes, chiles, cilantro or onions which are usually in a typical Ceviche. It was under- seasoned and just didn't work for me.The steak was tough. It came with a yellowish sauce which was bland. It resembled, but did not taste like, a thin Bearnaise sauce. The steak came with mash potatoes which were good.The dorado consisted of a whole fish on the bone. It was cooked perfectly but was under- seasoned and just a little bland.
